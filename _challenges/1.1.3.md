In the next section we are going to start working with larger programmes.
However, you can write simple programmes in the IDLE interactive prompt.

- Experiment with assigning values to variables.
- Use expressions which combine literals and operators.
- Enter expressions which combine your variables further.
- e.g. calculate the surface area and circumference of a circle with a given radius.
- Raise a NameError.
