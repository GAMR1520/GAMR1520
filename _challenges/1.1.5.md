Write the following code into a file **balance.py**

```python
if balanceA >= amount:
    balanceA -= amount
    balanceB += amount
```

Expand the programme by declaring the variables and giving them initial values.
Add some `print()` statements to generate output.
Try a few values for the variables to see what you get.
Can you produce errors by assigning the variables to data of the wrong types?

Remember, in IDLE you need to save code with *Ctrl + s* and press *F5* to execute.
