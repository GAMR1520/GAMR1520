lab: 1.1

Try writing some simple programmes of your own that combines everything you have learned so far.

Create new files and keep your experiments for later reference.

Write the code into a file **balance.py**
Expand the programme by declaring the variables and giving them initial values.
Add some `print()` statements to generate output.
Try a few values for the variables to see what you get.
Can you produce errors by assigning the variables to data of the wrong types?

Remember, you need to save code with *Ctrl + s* and press *F5* to execute.
