Write a programme that takes user input and outputs a requested times table.

```plaintext
>>>> Enter a number [1 - 12]: 5
(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60)
```

Can you use conditionals to restrict the programme to accept only integers between 1 and 12?

Once you have attempted this, download the

and compare.
Can you improve the solution?
