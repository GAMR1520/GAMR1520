title: Output the grid to the terminal
lab: 1.2
lang: python
---

Start with this code.

```python
grid = {
    (1, 1): "X",
    (0, 1): "O",
    (1, 2): "X",
    (1, 0): "O",
    (2, 2): "X",
    (0, 0): "O",
    (0, 2): "X",
}
```

We have a dictionary with 2-tuple keys and strings as values.

Write a programme to print the *noughts & crosses* grid out to the terminal.

```plaintext
O O   
O X   
X X X 
```

Once you have attempted it, look at this <a href="{{ "assets/solutions/week 1/grid_v1.py" | relative_url }}" download>basic solution</a> for comparison. It's not pretty, but it works.

Look ahead to the [looping](#iterables-and-looping) sections for ideas to simplify the code.
Once you have attempted it, look at this <a href="{{ "assets/solutions/week 1/grid_v2.py" | relative_url }}" download>much better solution</a> for comparison. 
It uses the `end` argument to the `print()` function.


Attempt another programme to print the *noughts & crosses* grid out to the terminal with fancier formatting.

```plaintext
 O | O |  
--- --- ---
 O | X |  
--- --- ---
 X | X | X 
```

Once you have made an attempt, check out these solutions.

Unfairly, we have used [string formatting]({{"references/f-strings" | relative_url }}) and [list comprehensions]({{"references/list-comprehensions" | relative_url }}) in our solutions.
We will cover these soon.
