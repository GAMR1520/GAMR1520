Write a programme to plot a horizontal bar chart made of equals signs (`=`) from an iterable containing integers.

The output, if given `range(10)`, should look something like this:

```plaintext
 0: 
 1: =
 2: ==
 3: ===
 4: ====
 5: =====
 6: ======
 7: =======
 8: ========
 9: =========
```

The output, if given `range(0, 20, 2)`, should look something like this:
```plaintext
 0: 
 2: ==
 4: ====
 6: ======
 8: ========
10: ==========
12: ============
14: ==============
16: ================
18: ==================
```
