title: A guessing game
lab: 1.3

OK, we've been through some of the very basic elements of programming.
Now Try to do something difficult.

Write a programme which generates [a random integer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint) and asks the user to guess it.
The output might look something like this:

```plaintext
====================
Guessing game
====================

Guess the number:
[1-100] >> 50

It's lower than 50:
[1-100] >> 25

It's higher than 25:
[1-100] >> 37

It's lower than 37:
[1-100] >> 31

It's higher than 31:
[1-100] >> 34

It's higher than 34:
[1-100] >> 36

It's lower than 36:
[1-100] >> 35
Well done!
The number was 35!
```

The numbers after `>> ` prompts are user input.

This is a non-trivial piece of code.
Don't worry about getting it perfect at first.
Here's a few ideas for how to start.

- put the line `from random import randint` at the top of your code.
- Use randint() to produce a random number and store it in a variable
- Print your number out at first, while you test the code.
- Print out a welcome message, formatted in the way you want it.
- Ask the user for a guess using a suitable prompt.
- Inform the user whether they got it, were high, or low.
- Implement a loop which breaks when the guess is correct.

If you want to extend this further, try adding a feature which allows the user to play again.
