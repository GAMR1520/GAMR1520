Write a programme that performs the opposite role.
In this case the player will guess a number and the programme will ask questions and try to guess.

```plaintext
===================================
Think of a number between 1 and 100
          (Don't tell me)           
===================================
Press ENTER when you are ready.

Is it 50?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it greater than 50?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it 25?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it greater than 25?
 [y/n] >> y

Is it 37?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it greater than 37?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it 31?
 [y/n] >> n

Is it greater than 31?
 [y/n] >> y

Is it 34?
 [y/n] >> y

I got it in 5 guesses!

[50, 25, 37, 31, 34]
```

*Hint*: The maximum and minimum possible values will start at `1` and `100`.
Use these numbers to produce a guess and when the player answers, update them accordingly.
