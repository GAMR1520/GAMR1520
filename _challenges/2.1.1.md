lab: 2.1

We can use the built in `dir()` method to list all the available attributes on a python object.

- Create a python script to write the output from `dir([])` into a file `list.txt`.
- Create a python script to write the output from `dir('hello')` into a file `string.txt`.

Make sure you use the context manager approach.
