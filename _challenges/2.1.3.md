title: More shopping lists
lab: 2.1
lang: python

Study the following simple programme.
The code allows a user to construct a shopping list on the command line.

There are three compound statements in the code.
- An infinite `while` loop which continues until it is exited using the `break` statement.
- An `if` conditional protecting the `break` statement which is controlled by user input.
- A `for` loop which prints each item of the list on a separate line.


```python
shopping = ()
width = 20
hline = '=' * width
while True:
    print(hline)
    print('shopping list'.center(width))
    print(hline)
    for item in shopping:
        print(item.center(width))
    print(hline)
    keep_going = input("add an item to the list? [y/n]")
    if not keep_going.lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    shopping += (input("New item: "),)
```

Make sure you understand the three compound statements in the code.

1. Add code *before* the `while` loop that loads the initial `shopping` data from a file.
1. Ad code *after* the `while` loop to save the data back to the file before it exits.

The code should still allow the user to append new values.

Once you have attempted this, download the <a href="{{"assets/solutions/week 1/shopping_list.py" | relative_url}}" download>solution</a> and compare.
Can you improve the solution?

What about editing items or deleting items from the list?
