title: More shopping lists
lab: 2.1
lang: python

Study the following simple programme.
The code allows a user to construct a shopping list on the command line.

There are three compound statements in the code.
- An infinite `while` loop which continues until it is exited using the `break` statement.
- An `if` conditional protecting the `break` statement which is controlled by user input.
- A `for` loop which prints each item of the list on a separate line.


```python
shopping = ()
width = 20
hline = '=' * width
while True:
    print(hline)
    print('shopping list'.center(width))
    print(hline)
    for item in shopping:
        print(item.center(width))
    print(hline)
    keep_going = input("add an item to the list? [y/n]")
    if not keep_going.lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    shopping += (input("New item: "),)
```

Make sure you understand the three compound statements in the code.

1. Add code *before* the `while` loop that loads the initial `shopping` data from a file.
1. Add code *after* the `while` loop to save the data back to the same file before it exits.

The code should still allow the user to append new values.

Once you have attempted this, download the <a href="{{"assets/solutions/week 2/shopping_list.py" | relative_url}}" download>solution</a> and compare.
Can you improve the solution?

What about editing items or deleting items from the list?
