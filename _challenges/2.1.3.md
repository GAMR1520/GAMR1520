title: More shopping lists
lab: 2.1

Study the following simple programme.
The code allows a user to construct a shopping list on the command line.

```python
my_list = ()
while True:
    hline = '*' * 20
    print(hline)
    print('shopping list'.center(20))
    print(hline)
    for item in my_list or ("EMPTY LIST".center(20),):
        print(item)
    print(hline)
    keep_going = input("add an item to the list? [y/n]")
    if not keep_going.lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    my_list += (input("New item: "),)

items = ["apples", "bananas", "cherries"]
print(formatted_list(items, title="fruit"))
```

1. Implement a feature that loads the initial list from a file.
1. Implement a feature to save the data back to the file before it exits.

The code should still allow the user to append new values.
Once you have attempted this, download the <a href="{{"assets/solutions/week 1/shopping_list.py" | relative_url}}" download>solution</a> and compare.
Can you improve the solution?

What about editing items or deleting items from the list?
