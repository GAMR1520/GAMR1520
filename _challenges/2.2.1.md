Spend some time understanding the following function.

```python
def formatted_list(items, title="list", ch='*'):
    width = max([len(i) for i in items + [title]]) + 4
    hline = ch * width
    result = [hline, title, hline] + items + [hline]
    result = [f"{ch}{i.center(width)}{ch}" for i in result]
    return "\n".join(result)
```

It may be short, but there is a lot going on.
It was developed using a process of continuous refactoring.
Read about [how it was put together]({{"references/refactoring" | relative_url }}).

The function can be used like this:

```python
f = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries']
print(formatted_list(f, title='fruit'))
```

It produces an output like this:

```plaintext
**************
*   fruit    *
**************
*   apples   *
*  bananas   *
*  cherries  *
**************
```

Notice there is still one literal value inside the function body.
The additional width added to each row is set to `4`.

Modify the function to include this as an optional argument `pad` with a default value of `4`.
Try to generate something like this with a function call.

```plaintext
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+           fruit            +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+           apples           +
+          bananas           +
+          cherries          +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
```

The code to create it might look something like this.

```python
f = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries']
l = formatted_list(f, title='fruit', ch="+", pad=20)
print(l)
```

The required change is actually very small.
