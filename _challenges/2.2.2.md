lab: 2.2
title: Build a simple converter
lang: python
---

We want to upgrade our `my_library` module into a very simple proof-of-concept for a *markdown*-like converter.

Imagine a system that allowed you to write files in a simple *markdown*-ish format.
It can convert plain text into `<p>` elements (paragraphs) but if you add a hash symbol (`#`) to the beginning of a line, then it will convert this into an `<h1>` element (a top-level heading).
Both headings and paragraphs should be separated by empty lines.

Our input file might look like this:

```md
# The Python Tutorial

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
```

Save a copy of [this file]({{"assets/examples/week 2/test.md" | relative_url}}) into your working folder.

Add the following function to your *my_library.py* module.
It loads text data from a file and splits it on double newline characters

```python
def load_data(path):
    with path.open('r') as f:
        return f.read().split('\n\n')
```


The function is very simple, it returns a list of items that should be converted to either `<h1>` elements (if they begin with `# `) or `<p>` elements (if they don't).

The output we want looks like this:

```html

```

We already have our `html_element` function for generating fragments of the output.
What we need is a function to manage the entire process of loading the data, converting each item into an HTML element (using our `html_element` function) and writing the result back to a file.


Complete the following function:

```python
def convert(inpath, outpath):
    data = load_data(inpath)

    # convert each item into an HTML element
    
    # write the HTML elements into the outpath file
```

We will call the function like this.

```python
here = Path(__file__).parent
inpath = here / 'test.md'
outpath = here / 'test.html'
convert(inpath, outpath)
```
