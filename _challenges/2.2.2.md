lab: 2.2
title: Parse the sample data
lang: python
---

Complete the `parse_md_file` function so it returns a list of strings.

It should split the raw data into a list based on double newline characters (`'\n\n'`).

The output should be a list containing the three chunks of content to be wrapped in HTML tags.
