Complete the `format_md_chunk()` function.

1. It should define a `tag` variable and set it to the value `'p'`.
1. It should look for `'# '` at the beginning of the chunk using [str.startswith()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith)
1. Within a [conditional statement]({{ "exercises/1.1#conditionals" | relative_url }}) it should set the `tag` variable to `'h1'` and strip off the first two characters of the content (maybe using [slicing]({{"exercises/1.2#slicing" | relative_url }})) **only** if it detects a heading.
1. It should pass the `tag` variable into `html_element()` along with the chunk content and return the result.
