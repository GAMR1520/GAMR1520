lab: 3.1
title: Create a class for a shopping list
lang: python
---

Create a `ShoppingList` class.
Your class should have a list of items (strings) and a title as the main instance attributes.
These should be passed in as arguments to the `__init__` constructor.

> You might add some other optional keyword arguments.

Use code from previous exercises to add a `__str__` method that prints a formatted version of the list.

The list should have methods to allow it to be updated (i.e. `__add__` and `__sub__` methods and/or the `__iadd__` and `__isub__` methods).

> Hint: since our list is mutable, it should `return self` at the end of these methods.

We should be able to use the class as follows.

```python
shopping = ShoppingList('apples', 'bananas', 
                        title='fruit', pad=10)
shopping += 'cherries'
shopping -= 'apples'
print(shopping)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
********************
*      fruit       *
********************
*     bananas      *
*     cherries     *
********************
```

> You may find it simpler to take a list as the first argument
> ```python
> shopping = ShoppingList(['apples', 'bananas'], 
                        title='fruit', pad=10)
>```
>Though it is easy enough to collect all the positional arguments together and generate a list from them.
