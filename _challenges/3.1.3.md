title: Implement a Line class
lang: python
---

We can now use our `Coordinates` class to build another level of complexity.

Create a `Line` class which takes two `Coordinate` instances into its constructor and saves them (e.g.`c1`, and `c2`).

Implement a `Line.length()` method to calculate the distance between the points.
Implement a `Line.slope()` method to calculate the gradient between the points.


Check they produce the following outputs.

```python
c1 = Coordinate(1, 3)
c2 = Coordinate(2, 4)
line = Line(c1, c2)

print(f"{line = }\n{line.gradient() = }\n{line.length() = }")
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
line = Line((1, 3) -> (2, 4))
line.gradient() = 1.0
line.length() = 1.4142135623730951
```
{: .small-margin}
