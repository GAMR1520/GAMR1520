title: Create a function for loading JSON data
lang: python
---

Write a `load_json()` function that takes a *url* as an argument and returns a prepared python object.
The function can assume that the response contains a json-formatted string. 

You should be able to replicate the above chain of requests like this:

```python
url = 'https://swapi.py4e.com/api/'
swapi = load_json(url)
people = load_json(swapi['people'])
```
