lab: 3.2
title: Create a unique list of planets
lang: python
---

Write a script to gather the people data from all pages.

1. Start the list by requesting the first page as we already have.
1. You will need to start an infinite loop.
1. Within the loop, request the json data from the url in the `next` key
1. Add the new data onto the result
1. You can `break` the loop if the `next` key is empty.

- Print a list of strings containing all the people names.
- Print a list of strings containing all the planet names.
- Convert your code into a reusable function `load_collection`.

A partial solution follows.
Make sure you have a go yourself before looking ahead.
