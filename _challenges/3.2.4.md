Inspect the swapi data.
Practice printing selected parts.
Try extracting the first value of a given type and printing the dictionary keys.

Try this...

```python
url = 'https://swapi.py4e.com/api/'
swapi = load_json(url)

# load all the species data
species = load_collection(swapi['species'])

# print the keys from the first item
print(species[0].keys())

# create a dictionary of species by classification
species_by_class = {}
for s in species:
    classification = s['classification'] 
    try:
        species_by_class[classification].append(s['name'])
    except KeyError:
        species_by_class[classification] = [s['name']]
print(species_by_class)
```

Try to calculate a few statistics.

For example:

- How many people from each species are listed?
- How many species from each classification are listed?
- How many people, planets, starships and vehicles are listed for each film?
- Which film has the longest "opening_crawl"?
