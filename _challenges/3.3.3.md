lab: 3.3
title: Saving and loading the list
lang: python
---

As in the previous example, we need our application to load a file on startup and save back to the file on exit.
Although there are significant differences.

>Hint: Remember, an entry widget can be assigned a `textvariable` to make the data accessible.
>
>Something like this in the `ShoppingItem` constructor:
>```python
>self.text = tk.StringVar(self.shopping_list, text)
>```
>will allow something like this in the `ShoppingList`:
>```python
>def save(self):
>    with self.path.open('w') as f:
>        for item in self.items:
>            print(item.text.get(), file=f)
>```
