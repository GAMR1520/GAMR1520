lab: 4.1
title: Add a few tests
lang: python
---

We should think about the kinds of data a user might pass into our function and decide what should happen in each case.

Write tests that define how our function should handle...

- negative values (e.g. `test_with_minus_five()`)
- extreme values (e.g. `test_with_one_billion()`)
- floating point values (e.g. `test_with_three_point_six()`)

**You will need to decide what the correct output is in each case.**

Run the tests.
If they don't pass then you need to decide whether you *change the code* or *change the test* to make them pass.
