Experiment with JavaScript functions.

1. In a new folder, create an HTML page with a single `<ol>` element inside the `<body>`.
1. Give the `<ol>` element an `id` attribute with a name you can use as a JavaScript variable
1. Write a function that takes a single argument and returns an `<li>` element with contents provided by the argument.
1. Create an array of strings and call the `Array.map` function on the array, passing your new function as a callback.
1. With the resultant array, call `Array.forEach` and insert each element into your `<ol>`.

If you need help with this, make sure you ask.
