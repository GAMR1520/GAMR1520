title: Elaborate on all the examples
lang: js

At this point you should be experimenting and being creative.

Create a series of five examples of your own, based on the examples in this exercise.

In each case:

- Extract the example into a separate HTML file with its own script file.
- Change the canvas dimensions
- Begin with the example code
- Modify the code to do something a bit different

Become familiar with the capabilities of the [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) API.

Now take an idea and run with it.
Create your JavaScript assignment submission.
