See if you can add a new feature such as giving each square a different colour.

Try to use [hsl()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) colours with template literals and animate the hue, saturation or lightness.

If you're not sure, check [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors).
