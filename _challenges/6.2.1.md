Build your own example, using a simple `frame()` function and `Scene` class.

Take some time to think about what you want to build.

Take it slowly, start as simple as possible.

- Consider the data your system will need.
- Implement the minimum possible, just to get something on the canvas.
- Gradually add features, one by one.

Evolve your code towards something you would be proud to submit for the assignment.
