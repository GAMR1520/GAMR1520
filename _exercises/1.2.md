title: Compound data types and looping
description: The second set of exercises looks at the more complex data types and the difference between mutable and immutable types. Combining what we have learned into some short programmes.
---

{% assign challenges = site.challenges | where:"lab", 1.2 | sort: "id" %}

In the last set of exercises we introduced some basic python syntax and data types.
We also introduced compound statements using the conditional `if` as an example.

In this set of exercises, we will introduce *compound data types* such as the `tuple`, `list`, `dictionary` and `set` and explore what they can do.
We will also expand our exploration of compound statements by looking at `while` and `for` loops.

## Sequences

In Python, a `sequence` is any object that contains items in a particular order.
Sequences have a length and provide access to contained items using integer indices.

As we have already seen, a string literal in python is a sequence of characters in quotes.
We can create a string with a literal, or with the `input()` function.

```python
msg1 = 'hello world'
msg2 = input('type in a string: ')
```

Other common sequences include `tuples` and `lists`.
These are more general purpose data types.
Both `tuples` and `lists` represent a sequence of values.
The main difference is that `lists` are *mutable*, whereas `tuples` are not.
There are also more exotic sequences such as `range` which can be used to generate sequences of numbers in a memory-efficient manner.

The following section applies to all sequences.
To begin, we will consider sequence operations on the more familiar `string` type.
We will use `'hello'`.

```python
message = 'hello'
```

Start a new script file and add the above line.
You can obviously choose any string you like.
If you do use a different string then you can expect different results.

### Sequences have length

We can use the built-in `len()` function to find the length of any sequence.
If we pass a string into the `len()` function we get an integer back.

```python
len(message)    # 5
```

> An integer is not a sequence.
> So this will raise a `TypeError`.
>
>```python
>len(5)         # TypeError!
>```
>
> Actually, objects don't need to be sequences to work with the `len()` function.
> They only need to implement a `__len__` method which `len()` tries to call.
> All sequences support this.
> The `TypeError` occurs when no such method exists.

### Indexing

If we want to access items from a sequence, we can do it by specifying the position of the items we want.
This is known as *indexing*.

Each item (character) has a position in the sequence (the string) known as the `index`.
The `index` is an integer, beginning with `0` as the first item (character).
In the above string, the character at position zero is `'h'`.

Indexing syntax uses square brackets to indicate which character (or sequence of characters) we want to reference by index.
This simple example gets the first character of a string.

```python
message[0]  # 'h'
```

>Or try this:
>```python
>name = input('Enter your name: ')
>print(f'Hello {name}, your name begins with "{name[0]}".')
>```

### Slicing

For multiple elements, we can specify the start and end indices, separated by a colon.
This is known as *slicing*.

```python
message[1:4] # 'ell'
```

The end index specifies the first character to exclude from the result.
So the return value of the above expression is a new string composed of the characters from indices 1, 2 and 3 but not position 4.

>People sometimes use the **i** and **e** in the word sl**i**c**e** to remember that the starting index is *inclusive* and the ending index is *exclusive*.
>You may or may not find this a useful way to remember the slicing behaviour.

We can also count from the end of the string using negative numbers.
Confusingly, the last character is indicated by an index of -1, the second last is -2 etc.

```python
message[-1] # 'o'
```

The above code returns the last character, an `'o'`.

We can, of course, use both positive and negative indices together.

```python
message[1:-2] # 'el'
```
The above code starts at the second character (index 1) and ends before the second character from the end (index -2).

Leaving an index blank whilst using a colon implies starting from the beginning or running to the end.

```python
message[:3]  # 'hel'
message[-3:] # 'llo'
```

Leaving both indices blank gives a copy of the original string.

```python
message[:]  # 'hello'
```

### Specifying a step

Slicing can also include a second colon and a final integer value to indicate the step.
So we can take a string and extract a new string which is composed of e.g. every second character starting at the 3rd character before the 17th character.

```python
message = 'happy birthday to you'
message[3:17:2] # 'p itdyt'
```

>This is all a little odd, and can be a major cause of confusion for some, but you get used to it very quickly with practice.

## Tuples

Tuples are sequences, just like strings.
However, they are much more flexible than strings because they can contain any values, not just characters.

We can define a tuple using square brackets surrounding items, separated by commas.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

The tuple `numbers`, contains ten integers.
We can use indexing and slicing to access the individual elements, just like with strings.

```python
numbers[0]      # 1
numbers[3]      # 4
numbers[::3]    # (1, 4, 7, 10)
numbers[::2]    # (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
numbers[1::2]   # (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

Tuples can hold any type of data and can mix different types.
They are extremely efficient and effective ways of collecting related information together rather than having many named variables.

```python
item1 = ('first item', 1, 2.6, 33452, 'yellow')
item2 = ('second item', 4, 9.3, 1034, 'blue')
```

Note that tuple literals with a single element require a trailing comma within the brackets to clarify that the parentheses are indicating we want a tuple rather than simply parentheses.

```python
('hello')   # evaluates to just 'hello'
('hello',)  # evaluates to the tuple ('hello', )
```

## Ranges

Consider a tuple like this.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
numbers[0]  # 1
numbers[9]  # 10
```

Now imagine if we wanted to extend this to 1,000,000 entries.
The act of creating the tuple will require all the values to be stored in memory.

The `range()` built-in allows us to create `range` objects which can achieve a very similar job with a fraction of the memory footprint.

```python
numbers = range(1, 1000001)
numbers[0]      # 1
numbers[999999] # 1000000
```

The above code creates a range object which is just what we needed.
It behaves exactly like the tuple we want, but it doesn't store the values in memory.
This is because it can calculate the value of any of its *virtual* items.

The `range()` function takes one, two or three arguments.
Similar to the *slicing* start, end and step values.
So we can also create ranges like this.

```python
fives = range(0, 101, 5)
len(fives)  # 21
fives[0]    # 0
fives[5]    # 25
fives[20]   # 100
```

Because sequences are zero-indexed, the last index is always one less than the length.

## Other sequence operations

In addition to indexing and slicing, all sequences benefit from some very convenient operators such as `in`.

```python
'hello' in ('a', ('n', 5), 'hello', [3, 2, 1])   # True
15 in range(0, 101, 5)                           # True
'Q' in 'klnad87Qfadkna63kd'                      # True
```

The `in` operator checks the sequence to see if the requested value appears as an item.
With strings, the `in` operator will also detect sub-strings.

```python
'or' in 'world'                                             # True
```

>The `in` operator works naturally with the `not` operator so a modified form is provided for readability and is preferred over the less clear alternative.
>```python
>not 0 in (1, 2, 3)  # <- don't use this
>0 not in (1, 2, 3)  # <- use this instead
>```

We can use the `+` operator to concatenate most sequence types together.

```python
'hello' + ' ' + 'world'   # 'hello world'
('one', 2) + ('three', 4.0)  # ('one', 2, 'three', 4.0)
```

> Mixing data types won't work usually.
> Also, range objects cannot be treated this way.

All sequences can be converted to tuples (or lists) easily.

```python
tuple('hello')          # ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
tuple(range(10, 21, 2)) # (10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)
list('hello')          # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
list(range(10, 21, 2)) # [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```

We can also use the `*` operator to repeat sequences multiple times.
In this case we need to 'multiply' by an integer.

```python
'hello ' * 3      # 'hello hello hello '
('hello', ) * 3   # ('hello', 'hello', 'hello')
```

>Notice the trailing comma for a 1-tuple literal.

> Again, range objects cannot be treated this way.
> But they can be converted to tuples or lists.

Combinations are possible.
The `*` operator takes precedence over the `+` operator.

Compare this: 

```python
message = 'hello ' * 3 + 'world'
```

with this:

```python
message = 'hello' + 3 * ' world'
```

> Try this with tuples or lists

Attempting to use the `*` operator with the wrong types will raise a `TypeError`, indicating that the type was wrong.
```python
'hello' * 'three'
'hello' * 3.2
```

## Mutable types

Most of the data types we have introduced so far (tuples, strings, booleans, integers and floats) are *immutable*, which means their values cannot be changed once created.
We can see this demonstrated if we try to change a character within a string.

```python
message = 'hello'
message[1] = 'a'
```

The result is a `TypeError` saying that the `str` object does not support item assignment.

We get a similar result if we try to change an element of a tuple.

```python
data = ('hello', 'world')
data[1] = 'python'
```

>There are three main built-in mutable data types in python, the `list`, `dict` and `set`.
>
>```python
>my_list = ['a', 'b']
>my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>my_set = {'a', 'b'}
>```
>
>These types are very simple to use as we shall see.
>When used together, they provide powerful tools for creating flexible data structures within your programmes.

## Lists

The Python `list` is effectively a mutable version of the tuple data type.
We can change the content of lists after they have been created.

```python
data = ['hello', 'world']
data[1] = 'python'
```

### Replacing elements

It's perfectly OK to replace an element in a python list.
We can do this by assigning to an element using the square bracket syntax we saw with slicing.

```python
my_list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries']
my_list[1] = 'blueberries'
```

In the above example, the list contains three strings and we replace the 2nd element of the list (`'bananas'` at position 1) with a new string `'blueberries'`.

We can also replace multiple elements in a list using the familiar slicing syntax.
In this case, we need to assign to an iterable such as a sequence.

```python
my_list = list('hello')
my_list[2:4] = (1, 1)
```

> The above code first creates the list `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].
> It then replaces the specified slice (the ['l', 'l'] part) with a new sequence.

Any sequence can be used, and the length of the sequence doesn't have to be the same as the slice.
For example, in the following code, we insert five integers at position 5, replacing the string 'a'.

```python
my_list = list("abracadabra")
my_list[5:6] = range(5)
```


> Be careful because the following will not produce the same result
> ```python
> my_list = list("abracadabra")
> my_list[5] = range(5)
> ```
> When assigning a sequence to an individual item, the sequence is inserted as a single item.
> To inject a sequence into another sequence requires the slicing notation which specified a sub-sequence to be replaced rather than a single item, even if the sub-sequence has a length of one.

If you want to, you can also use the slicing step notation to specify a distributed sequence.

```python
my_list = list("abracadabra")   # ['a', 'b', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'r', 'a']
my_list[::2] = range(6)         # [ 0,  'b',  1 , 'a',  2 , 'a',  3 , 'a',  4 , 'r',  5 ]
```

### Deleting elements

To remove an element from a mutable sequence, use the `del` keyword.

```python
my_list = list("abracadabra")   # ['a', 'b', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'r', 'a']
del my_list[::2]
my_list                         # ['b', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'r']
```

The keyword `del` can also be used to delete objects from memory and *deassign* variables.
We can see this in the following code.

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]   # define 'my_list'
del my_list         # delete 'my_list'
print(my_list)      # NameError: name 'my_list' is not defined
```

### Appending elements

We can also add items to a list using the `append()` method.
We call methods using dot notation like this:

```python
my_list = list('hello') # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
my_list.append('hello') # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'hello']
```

> A *method* is a function that is defined within a class and so is associated with objects of that class.
> This means methods can modify an object directly in potentially complex ways.
> When we create our own classes of objects, we will define our own custom methods.

This produces a very similar result to the `+` operator.
Although the `+` operator only works with other lists.

```python
my_list = list('hello') # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
my_list += ['hello']    # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'hello']
```

## Dictionaries

The Python `dict` type is a mutable, compound data type like a list.
However, it is not a sequence.
Elements in a `dict` are not stored against their integer position but rather, each *value* is associated with a *key*.

An empty `dict` literal is a pair of curly braces (`{}`).
Indexing is just like the list, but rather than using integers, we can use any immutable value as the key.

```python
my_dict = {}
my_dict['hello'] = 'world'
```

In the above example we are storing the value `'world'` against the key `'hello'`.
We can retrieve the value like this:

```python
print(my_dict['hello'])
```

An example use case for a dictionary is to store lots of related values.
Dictionary entries are *key: value* pairs separated by colons.
Multiple entries can be comma-separated.

```python
stock = {
    'apples': 15,
    'bananas': 12,
    'cherries': 126
}
```

In the above code, we are storing integers against string keys within a single dictionary. 
Adding or editing items would be simple.

```python
stock['bananas'] += 1
stock['dates'] = 10
```

Lists containing dictionaries are a common way to gather complex related data.

```python
animals = [
    {'name': 'Anteater', 'description': 'Eats ants'},
    {'name': 'Bear', 'description': 'Grizzly'},
    {'name': 'Chimp', 'description': 'Chump'},
    {'name': 'Dog', 'description': 'Friend'}
]

choice = animals[2]

print(choice['name'])
print(choice['description'])

```

Dictionary keys don't need to be strings.
The following example contains data for a noughts & crosses game using tuples of x, y coordinates as the key.

```python
grid = {
    (1, 1): "X",
    (0, 1): "O",
    (1, 2): "X",
} # The game is already won!

grid[(1, 0)] = "O"  # Forced move
grid[(2, 2)] = "X"  # The clincher
grid[(0, 0)] = "O"  # Forced move
grid[(0, 2)] = "X"  # X wins!
```
Notice the grid can be sparsely populated.
It's not necessary to have items for all the cells.

If we want to check for a value, we can use the `in` operator just as we did for sequences.
For dictionaries, the `in` (and `not in`) operator will check to see if the requested value is in the keys.

```python
(1, 1) in grid      # True
(1, 2) not in grid  # True
```

{% assign challenge = challenges[1] %}
{% include challenge.md challenge=challenge %}

## Sets

A [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) is a collection of unique items. 
We can create a set using a set literal, which has similarities to list and dict literals.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, "A", "a", "A"} # {1, 2, 3, 'a', 'A'}
```

Alternatively, any iterable object (such as a sequence or a dict) can be passed into the `set()` function (which is actually the constructor for the set type).

```python
my_set = set('abracadabra') # {'b', 'r', 'c', 'a', 'd'}
```

Individual items can be added using the `add` method and removed using the `remove` method.

```python
my_set = set('abracadabra') # {'b', 'r', 'c', 'a', 'd'}
my_set.add('z')             # {'b', 'r', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'z'}
my_set.remove('a')          # {'b', 'r', 'c', 'd', 'z'}
```

We can also do useful set operations such as *union* (using the `|` operator), *intersection* (using the `&` operator) and *difference* (using the `-` operator).

```python
a = set('abracadabra')  # {'b', 'r', 'c', 'a', 'd'}
b = set('hello world')  # {'l', 'w', 'r', 'h', 'o', ' ', 'd', 'e'}
a | b                   # {'b', 'l', 'w', 'r', 'h', 'c', 'o', 'a', 'd', ' ', 'e'}
a & b                   # {'r', 'd'}
a - b                   # {'b', 'c', 'a'}
b - a                   # {'l', 'w', 'h', 'o', ' ', 'e'}
```




## Iterables and looping

There are two main ways to loop in python.
We can either loop based on logic, using a `while` loop or we can loop over data, using a `for` loop.

### The `while` loop

A basic kind of loop is a `while` loop.
This acts as a kind of extended and continuous conditional.
The `while` clause behaves like an `if` clause that repeats itself until the condition fails.

The header begins with the `while` keyword and a conditional test followed by a colon.
The indented code block following the header will be executed repeatedly as long as the conditional resolves to `True`.

> There is a real danger that a `while` loop can continue forever.
> If this happens, press `Ctrl + C` to exit the programme.

Here's a modified version of the conditional code that repeatedly transfers an amount from `balanceA` to `balanceB`.
It stops when `balanceA` is less than `amount`.

```python
balanceA = 95
balanceB = 0
amount = 10
print(f"balance A {balanceA}, balance B {balanceB}")
while balanceA >= amount:
    balanceA -= amount
    balanceB += amount
    print(f"balance A {balanceA}, balance B {balanceB}")
```

> `while` clauses can have `else` clauses added too which will execute once, when the conditional expression resolves to `False`.
> Can you explain why these are not commonly used?

One issue with the while loop is that the condition is always checked *before* the first execution of the code block.
Many languages include a `do...until` construct which allows code to be executed once *before* the conditional is tested.
Python has no such construct.

A common way to use a `while` loop in this way is to create an infinite loop (`while True`) and use the `break` keyword to exit the loop based on some condition.
This provides all the necessary flexibility.

```python
i = 0
while True:
    print(f"this is iteration {i}")
    if input("break loop? [y/n] ").lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    i += 1
```

> Notice the use of string methods `str.lower()`, `str.startswith()` and the use of `f-strings`.
> We will discuss these in the next section

The infinite loop keeps our code clean and avoids repetition.


### The `for` loop

In python, an `iterable` is any object that can release one item at a time.
Sequences are a special kind of *iterable* that yields its elements in order and supports integer indexing.

In practice, this means (amongst other things) that an *iterable* object (such as a sequence) can be looped over using a `for` loop, yielding each element in turn.

A `for` clause is similar to a `while` clause or an `if` clause.
However, in place of a conditional test, we name a variable and an iterable object.
The code block will repeat, setting the variable to each element in the iterable in turn and executing the code block.

```python
for i in (1, 2, 3):
    print(i)
```

In the above case, we declare a variable `i` within the header to receive each element of the iterable in turn.
the code block will be executed three times with the the variable `i` assigned to the values `1`, then `2` and then `3`.

This allows for fun with sequences.

```python
for ch in input("Enter your name: "):
    print(ch * 10 + "!")
```

The capabilities of `for` loops and `while` loops are subtly different.
Though in many cases they can be used interchangeably, there is often a natural fit to the problem at hand.

Consider how the following code uses looping to achieve a clear purpose.

```python
my_list = ()
while True:
    print('=' * 20)
    print('shopping list'.center(20))
    print('-' * 20)
    for item in my_list or ("EMPTY LIST".center(20),):
        print(item)
    print('=' * 20)
    keep_going = input("add an item to the list? [y/n]")
    if not keep_going.lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    my_list += (input("New item: "),)
```

The code above uses many of the techniques we have introduced to maintain a tuple containing strings representing items on a shopping list.
The programme starts by assigning an empty tuple to the `my_list` variable.
> This could easily be a `list`, but we chose a `tuple`.

The *infinite* `while` loop repeats the main code block until the `break` statement is reached when user decides to stop.

In each loop, the programme prints out the list with some formatting.
This takes most of the lines of code.
Once the list is printed, the programme then asks the user if they want to add an item to the list.

If their answer doesn't begin with a `'y'` then the programme breaks out of the loop and ends.
If they indicate that they want to continue, they are asked for a new item and whatever they enter is appended to the `my_list` tuple.

The programme can go on infinitely, but can easily be ended by the user.

> Were the user to add enough items to the list, the available memory would eventually run out.
However, it is likely that the user would run out of patience before this became a problem.
