lang: python
title: Problem solving
description: This final session of week 1 includes a few coding challenges that use what we have learned so far.

{% assign challenges = site.challenges | where:"lab", 1.3 | sort: "id" %}

Now we have a basic understanding of data types and looping, we can start creating our own code.
Spend some time completing these coding challenges.

If you find them easy, then ask for something harder.

If you find them difficult, ask the people around you and your tutor for some clues.

{% for challenge in challenges %}
{{ challenge }}
{% endfor %}

Make sure you complete these before next week.
