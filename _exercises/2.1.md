In this set of exercises we will explore how to use python to save and load structured data to and from files.
For now we will be looking at low level file access.

In later sections we will look at how to work with specific file formats.
We are also going to introduce parts of the standard python library that can help with this.
In particular, `pathlib`.

## basic file IO

The most common way to interact with files in python is using the built-in [open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) function.
The `open()` function returns a file object exposing methods such as `read()` and `write()` which allow use to load and save data to the file system.

When creating a file object, we need to specify the location of the file and either read ('r') or write ('w') mode.
For example, when a file is open for read-only actions, it cannot be used to write data.

>The default read and write modes read and write strings to files.
There are other modes (e.g. for reading/writing binary data) but we can ignore these for now. 
They work in a very similar way.

### Writing to files

The following code will create a file in the current directory called *shopping.txt*.

> file paths are always relative to the location from which the code was executed.
> This is sometimes the location of the python source code.
> But code can be executed from another location.

```python
file = open('shopping.txt', 'w')
file.write("apples")
file.write("bananas")
file.write("cherries")
file.close()
```

The above code will create the file if it doesn't exist. 
It will replace any existing content in the file with the string 'applesbananascherries'.

### Reading from files

We can read the data from a file into a programme by opening the file in read mode and calling the `read()` method.

```python
file = open('shopping.txt', 'r')
print(file.read())
file.close()
```

Following the example above, the output is as follows:

```plaintext
applesbananascherries
```

> Be careful with this.
> the `read()` method will read the entire file by default.
> If the file is larger than the available memory, you may have a problem.
>
> Optionally, you can pass a number of characters to read
> ```python
> file.read(10)
> ```
> In our example, this would read `'applesbana'`.

If the file does not exist, the code will raise a **FileNotFoundError**.

## Context managers

When we are finished working with a file, it is important that we close it.
Python has a built in way to do this using a `context manager`.
Context managers allow us to use a `with` clause to acquire and release resources such as files.
We specify a code block to handle the resource.

So we can rewrite the above examples like this:

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("apples")
    file.write("bananas")
    file.write("cherries")
```

> THis is familiar syntax, it's another compound statement.

Notice we no longer need to close the file because the context manager automatically closes it for use when the code block ends.
It will also close the file in the event of an error.

> Always (ALWAYS) use `with` clauses to open files.

We can read our data in a similar way.

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
print(data)
```

## Line-oriented files

It is very common to organise data in files using line breaks (or newline characters) as separators.
If we want to add line breaks we can simply add them into our data using the newline character `'\n'`.

```python
file = open('shopping.txt', 'w')
file.write("apples\n")
file.write("bananas\n")
file.write("cherries\n")
file.close()
```

This produces an output which is divided into entries that can be easily extracted individually.

```
apples
bananas
cherries
```

There are a number of ways to extract the data back out.

## reading line-by-line

For line-delimited data we can also use the `readline()` method to read one line of our file.

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
    apples = file.readline()
    bananas = file.readline()
    cherries = file.readline()
print(apples)
print(bananas)
print(cherries)
```

> Notice that each line retains its newline character

Another option is to use the `readlines()` method (plural) to read the whole file contents as a list of the lines in the file.

This allows easy access to data via slicing and other sequence operations. 

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.readlines()
print(data[1]) # 'bananas\n'
```

> Passing a file object into the `list` constructor will do much the same thing.
>```python
>with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
>    data = list(file)
>print(data[1]) # 'bananas\n'
>```


Alternatively, since the file objects are iterable, it can be useful to iterate directly over them.

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```
Again, the newline characters are kept.

## Using string methods

A common pattern to remove the newline characters is to use the string method `splitlines()`.

```python
with open('shopping.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file.read().splitlines():
        print(line)
```

Here the file `read()` method returns the complete string contents of the files with newline characters intact and the `splitlines()` method divides the string into a list of lines with the newline delimiters removed.

> Note that again, this will load the entire file so, for very large files, it may not be an appropriate approach.

# JSON data

[Javascript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is a very simple and very common, human-readable data format for transferring data between systems.

Essentially, the json format maps onto the core python data types, numbers, strings and booleans as well as dictionaries and lists.

Let's start with a nested python data structure, anything will do. 

```python
saved_game = {
    "health": 82,
    "attack": 21,
    "shield": 5,
    "magic": 76,
    "speed": 45,
    "inventory": [
        {"name": "blue potion", "type": "health", "power": 6},
        {"name": "massive sword", "type": "weapon", "power": 9}
    ],
    "check-point": 84
}
```

Python provides the [built-in json module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) for generating/handling json data.
The most important functions are ``load()` and `dump()` which will read and write data to files. 
It's also possible to work directly with strings using `loads()` and `dumps()`.

The following code converts the dictionary into a json string.

```python
import json

my_json = json.dumps(saved_game)
print(my_json)
```

The string output contains the same data in json format.

```
'{"health": 82, "attack": 21, "shield": 5, "magic": 76, "speed": 45, "inventory": [{"name": "blue potion", "type": "health", "power": 6}, {"name": "massive sword", "type": "weapon", "power": 9}], "check-point": 84}'
```

You will notice, the output is very similar to the python syntax.
The main difference is that the quotes are now all double.

> There are some more significant differences, form example, json objects (equivalent to dictionaries) can only have string keys so if we use e.g. numeric keys, they will be converted to strings.
> If we use more complex objects as keys (e.g. tuples) then the conversion will fail with a TypeError.

For convenience, we can pass formatting parameters such as `indent` to `dumps()`.

```python
my_json = json.dumps(saved_game, indent=2)
print(my_json)
```

This produces a much more readable string with newline characters and spaces for indentation.

```
{
  "health": 82,
  "attack": 21,
  "shield": 5,
  "magic": 76,
  "speed": 45,
  "inventory": [
    {
      "name": "blue potion",
      "type": "health",
      "power": 6
    },
    {
      "name": "massive sword",
      "type": "weapon",
      "power": 9
    }
  ],
  "check-point": 84
}
```

We can also use the `dump()` method to write the result to a file.
The same `indent` parameter is also an option here.

```python
import json

with open("saved_game.json", 'w') as f:
    json.dump(saved_game, f, indent=2)
```

Reading the json data back out from our file is also very simple.

```python
import json

with open("saved_game.json", 'r') as f:
    my_dict = json.load(f)
print(my_dict)
```

JSON provides a very convenient way to store complex data and is an excellent data interchange format between programmes, whether they are written in python or any other language.


# Working with multiple files

We can expand the ideas above very easily by imagining a system that saves data in multiple files.
Imagine, for example that our system can handle many saved game files, each of which stores data associated with game progress for a different game.

For simplicity, let's define a naming convention whereby the file name used includes the date of creation as follows.

```
game-hhmmss-dd-mm-yyyy
```

For this, we will use the built-in `datetime` module.



```python
saved_game = {
    "health": 82,
    "attack": 21,
    "shield": 5,
    "magic": 76,
    "speed": 45,
    "inventory": [
        {"name": "blue potion", "type": "health", "power": 6},
        {"name": "massive sword", "type": "weapon", "power": 9}
    ]
    "check-point": 84
}
```

Let us also assume that there is a folder in which all saved game files will be stored.
So creating a file might look like this:

```python
```

<!-- SAVED GAME EXAMPLE?? -->
<!-- Noughts & crosses?? -->
<!-- 2048? -->




## Making things easier with pathlib

The built-in module [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) is relatively new, having been introduced in python 3.4.
So you may find lots of example code online that uses the approaches above.
In my own code, I always use pathlib when I need to work with files and folders, simply because it makes things neater.

The core of `pathlib` is the `Path` class.
The `Path` class allows us to create path *instances*, objects that represent individual paths.

```python
my_path = Path('shopping.txt')
with my_path.open('r') as my_file:
    data = my_file.read().splitlines()
```

        Starting with the programme below, implement a feature that loads a list from a file and allows the user to append new values.
        The programme should save the data back to the file before it exits.

```python
my_list = ()
while True:
    print('=' * 20)
    print('shopping list'.center(20))
    print('-' * 20)
    for item in my_list or ("EMPTY LIST".center(20),):
        print(item)
    print('=' * 20)
    keep_going = input("add an item to the list? [y/n]")
    if not keep_going.lower().startswith('y'):
        break
    my_list += (input("New item: "),)
```
