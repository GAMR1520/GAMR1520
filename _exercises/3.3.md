In this lab session we will play with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit originally designed for the Tcl language.
The official python documentation is not great for learning `tkinter`. More useful documentation can be found [here](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/index.html). 

>If you want to explore the tkinter system further then [the tk-tutorial](https://tk-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is very good.

`tkinter` allows us to build complex GUI's very easily. 
However, it won't do the **design work** for us. 
We need to design our interface first and then implement the design using `tkinter`.
This means understanding exactly where we want our widgets to appear.

{% include toc.md %}


## Inheriting from `tk.Tk`

To use tkinter, we first need to import it.
A common convention is to rename the module as `tk` to keep the name short, as it may be used a lot.

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

Then we will need a top-level window to contain our interface.
We do this by inheriting from `tk.Tk`.

The `tk.Tk` class is a top-level window.
It is the window which, if closed, will close the entire application.

```python
import tkinter as tk

class MyApplication(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # add and position `widgets` here
```

> We haven't seen inheritance before. 
> Inheritance allows us to take the existing `tk.Tk` class and add our own extensions to it. 
>
> We could have inherited from `tk.Frame` or from nothing at all. 
Using `tk.Tk` as the basis for simple apps makes things a little easier.

Our class now *is* a `tk.Tk` object.
But this code doesn't yet contain anything visible.

## Labels

We need to add some widgets.

> The visible things on our window are known as *widgets*.

So lets add some simple `tk.Label` widgets.
Labels are one of the simplest *widgets*, they just present text.

```python
import tkinter as tk

class MyApplication(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.intro1 = tk.Label(text="This is just some text")
        self.intro2 = tk.Label(text="and some more")
        self.intro1.grid()
        self.intro2.grid()
```

Notice we specify the `text` as an argument when we create a `tk.Label` instance.

Creating a widget does not automatically place it in our window.

> This is good.
> It separates the code for widget creation from its positioning.
> This means we need to write quite a lot of code, but it makes the system very flexible.
> For example, our application might have a hidden widget that should be shown only sometimes, or it might move a widget around depending on our own custom logic.

We need to call the `grid()` method on each label in order to register it with the `grid` *geometry manager* and place it on the interface.

> Other geometry managers are available, but we will use `grid` to position all our widgets because it is the most flexible.
> Online examples will often use other geometry managers.

At the end of our script, we can now create an instance of our application and start the tkinter main loop like this.

```python
app = MyApplication()
app.mainloop()
```

This results in a simple application window with two labels.

![A basic application]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_00.png" | relative_url }})

>Your window manager may produce a different, but similar result.

### A bit more style

Our application looks a bit basic and has the default title 'tk'. 
We can set the title of the main window by calling `self.title` and passing in the string we want to be displayed.

There are many ways to add some style. 
We can add some padding around the labels by passing keyword arguments to `grid`.
Usually, layout is handled by these `grid` calls.

We can also choose the fonts to be used as an argument to the `tk.Label` constructor.

Here's an upgraded example.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 12)
large = ('Helvetica', 18)

class MyApplication(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Application')
        self.intro1 = tk.Label(
            text="This is just some text", 
            font=large
        )
        self.intro2 = tk.Label(
            text="and some more", 
            font=small
        )

        self.intro1.grid(pady=(20, 0), padx=50)
        self.intro2.grid(pady=(0, 20))

app = MyApplication()
app.mainloop()
```

> Try changing the label colours using the `fg` (foreground) and `bg` (background) arguments.

We declared some variables to hold the font values.
Fonts are set as two-tuples containing the font-family name and the font size.

>Notice we set `padx` to a single value, `50` which is applied left and right but we set `pady` to a two-element tuple representing top and bottom padding.

![Add some padding and a title]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_01.png" | relative_url}})


>Other useful keywords for styling are `fg` and `bg` which are used to set the foreground colour (i.e. the text colour) and the background colour.

>Try experimenting with different values for padding, font size, colours and so on.

## Buttons

Buttons are easy enough.
The only thing to remember is to add a `command` argument.
This can be set to any function or method (anything `callable`).
Buttons will call their `command` when they are clicked.


```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 12)
large = ('Helvetica', 18)

class MyApplication(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Application')
        self.intro1 = tk.Label(
            text="This is just some text", 
            font=large
        )
        self.intro2 = tk.Label(
            text="and some more", 
            font=small
        )
        self.btn = tk.Button(
            text="Click me", 
            font=large, 
            command=self.clicked
        )

        self.intro1.grid(pady=(20, 0), padx=50)
        self.intro2.grid()
        self.btn.grid(pady=20)

    def clicked(self):
        print("I was clicked!!")

app = MyApplication()
app.mainloop()

```

The resulting application looks like this.

![Buttons are easy]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_02.png" | relative_url}})

Clicking the button now calls our `clicked` method which simply prints a message to the console.

We can make the button do anything.
Perhaps it's more useful to count how many clicks have occurred and to display the number by updating the button text.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 12)
large = ('Helvetica', 18)

class MyApplication(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Application')
        self.intro1 = tk.Label(
            text="This is just some text", 
            font=large
        )
        self.intro2 = tk.Label(
            text="and some more", 
            font=small
        )
        self.btn = tk.Button(
            text="Click me", 
            font=large, 
            command=self.clicked
        )

        self.intro1.grid(pady=(20, 0), padx=50)
        self.intro2.grid()
        self.btn.grid(pady=20)

        self.count = 0

    def clicked(self):
        self.count += 1
        self.btn.configure(text=f'{self.count} clicks')

app = MyApplication()
app.mainloop()
```

We can update widget configuration at any time using the generic widget [configure](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/universal.html) method.
Here we are using it to update the `text` argument of the `self.btn` attribute.

> Keeping references to our widgets is not strictly necessary unless we want to interact with them.
> The `tkinter` system will keep a list of all the widgets we create, so they are not garbage collected.

![Something a bit more useful?]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_03.png" | relative_url }})

Clicking on the button will now update the button text to reflect the click count.

>It's important to understand that when we create our widgets, they only exist in memory and will not be shown in the app.
>They only appear when we call `grid()` (or something equivalent).
>
>The `grid()` method also tells our app where the widget should be placed.


## Listbox and entry widgets

We are going to build a simple shopping list application to manage our usual list of strings.

The `tk.Listbox` widget holds a list of strings and will be used to display the shopping list.
To get information into our application, we need a `tk.Entry` widget.

A `tk.Entry` widget provides a way to take user input, a bit like the `input()` function.

>See documentation on the [tk.Listbox](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/listbox.html) and [tk.Entry](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/entry.html) widgets.

We are imagining an application where the user can manage a list.
The user must be able to enter text and click an 'add' button to add a new item to the list.
We also want to allow the user to select an item in the list and to update or delete the selected item by clicking either the 'update' or 'delete' button.

So, we need:
- a label with the application title
- a listbox, containing our items
- an entry field for specifying new and updated items
- an 'add' button
- an 'update' button
- a 'delete' button

First, let's just add the widgets into our application.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 18)
large = ('Helvetica', 24)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Shopping List')

        # create widgets
        self.label = tk.Label(
            text='My awesome shopping list app', 
            font=large
        )
        self.list = tk.Listbox(
            selectmode=tk.SINGLE, 
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.entry = tk.Entry(
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.add_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Add", 
            font=large
        )
        self.update_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Update", 
            font=large
        )
        self.delete_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Delete", 
            font=large
        )

        # position widgets
        self.label.grid(padx=20, pady=20)
        self.list.grid(padx=20, pady=20)
        self.entry.grid(padx=20, pady=20)
        self.add_btn.grid(padx=20, pady=20)
        self.update_btn.grid(padx=20, pady=20)
        self.delete_btn.grid(padx=20, pady=20)

app = ShoppingList()
app.mainloop()
```

>Notice we have changed the name of the application.

The code is already quite long.
Notice the widget creation all happens at once and the layout code is grouped together.
This will help us to think about positioning the elements separately from creating them.

We have updated the font sizes and chosen fonts for each of the different widgets (you can experiment with this) and we have set the `width` argument for the `tk.Entry` and the `tk.Listbox`.
>The `width` for these widgets is specified in characters, not pixels.

We also specified the `selectmode` for the `Listbox` so that only one item can be selected at a time.

In terms of layout, we have added 20px of padding around each widget.

![Disorganised widgets]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_04.png" | relative_url }})

## Layout using `grid()`

OK, we have all the necessary widgets.
Notice that by default, they appear in one column and are placed in the order of creation, with a new row being created for each widget.

The `tk.Listbox` widget has been given 10 rows by default so it is much taller than the other widgets.
>You can change this by setting the `height` argument.

Our widgets are not arranged in a very intuitive way.
Let's work to a design with five rows and two columns.

<table class="app" style="text-align: center; min-width: 400px">
    <tr><th></th><th>1</th><th>2</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <th>1</th><td colspan=2>tk.Label</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td class="entry">tk.Entry</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td class="listbox" rowspan=3 style="min-width: 220px;">tk.Listbox</td>
        <td>tk.Button</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>tk.Button</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>5</th>
        <td>tk.Button</td>
    </tr>
</table>

From this design, we can now list the `column` and the `row` for each widget.
These will be passed in as parameter to the `grid()` method.
We will also set our `Label` to span two columns (`columnspan=2`) and our `Listbox` to span three rows (`rowspan=3`).

For complex designs, producing a table like this can be useful.

| widget        | row | column | rowspan | columnspan |
|:--------------|:---:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| label         | 0   | 0      | -       | 2          |
| entry         | 1   | 0      | -       | -          |
| listbox       | 2   | 0      | 3       | -          |
| add button    | 2   | 1      | -       | -          |
| update button | 3   | 1      | -       | -          |
| delete button | 4   | 1      | -       | -          |


We can now set the `row`, `column`, `rowspan` and `columnspan` arguments to `grid()` to the appropriate values for each widget.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 12)
large = ('Helvetica', 18)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Shopping List')

        # create widgets
        self.label = tk.Label(
            text='My awesome shopping list app', 
            font=large
        )
        self.list = tk.Listbox(
            selectmode=tk.SINGLE, 
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.entry = tk.Entry(
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.add_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Add", 
            font=large
        )
        self.update_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Update", 
            font=large
        )
        self.delete_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Delete", 
            font=large
        )
        # position widgets
        self.label.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=0, 
            column=0, 
            columnspan=2
        )
        self.entry.grid(
            padx=20, 
            row=1, 
            column=0
        )
        self.list.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=0, 
            rowspan=3
        )
        self.add_btn.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=1
        )
        self.update_btn.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=3, 
            column=1
        )
        self.delete_btn.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=4, 
            column=1
        )

app = ShoppingList()
app.mainloop()
```
Make sure you understand what happened here.

>Notice, I also removed the top/bottom padding from the entry widget to make it sit between the label and the listbox padding.
Obviously, you can experiment to make it look however you want.

![Nicely positioned widgets]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_05.png" | relative_url }})

Finally, we can tweak the layout of each widget by specifying how each should fill the space provided by the grid cell(s) it occupies.
A common way to do this is to set the `sticky` argument.

In this case, we want the buttons to fill their containers.
To do this, we specify that they should `stick` to the north, south, east and west edges of their container.
In all cases, set `sticky="nsew"`.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 18)
large = ('Helvetica', 24)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Shopping List')

        # create widgets
        self.label = tk.Label(
            text='My awesome shopping list app', 
            font=large
        )
        self.list = tk.Listbox(
            selectmode=tk.SINGLE, 
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.entry = tk.Entry(
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.add_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Add", 
            font=large
        )
        self.update_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Update", 
            font=large
        )
        self.delete_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Delete", 
            font=large
        )

        # position widgets
        self.label.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=0, 
            column=0, 
            columnspan=2
        )
        self.entry.grid(
            padx=20, 
            row=1, 
            column=0
        )
        self.list.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=0, 
            rowspan=3
        )
        self.add_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=1
        )
        self.update_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            row=3, 
            column=1
        )
        self.delete_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            pady=20, 
            row=4, 
            column=1
        )

app = ShoppingList()
app.mainloop()
```

The final layout is like this:

![Beautiful]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_06.png" | relative_url }})

>Phew!
This took a lot of code.
Making something look nice (or nice enough) requires careful positioning (the `column`, `row`, `columnspan` and `rowspan` properties, a table is useful to plan this) and precise use of the `sticky`, `padx` and `pady` properties to get everything to line up nicely.

## Activating the Entry widget

Now we have our layout finalised, we can work on making the application do something useful.
The core user interactions will involve entering text into the entry widget, selecting items in the list and clicking the buttons. 

In order to make accessing the data from an entry widget easy, we need to specify a `tk.stringVar` which can be read from and written to.

> This is just how `tkinter` works.
> Basically we can tie the `tk.stringVar` to a widget and it will give us a way to read and write the data using `get()` and `set()` methods.
> Its inconvenient but the alternative using `configure` is much worse.

Add the following into our `__init__` method.
Make sure to run this code before the `tk.Entry` widget is created.

```python
# the current/new item
self.item = tk.StringVar()
```

Now we can update our `tk.Entry` widget to use our variable like this.

```python
self.entry = tk.Entry(
    font=large, 
    width=30, 
    textvariable=self.item
)
```

This will allow us to access the text in the entry more easily.

>The `tk.StringVar` (and equivalent numeric values) system is useful when different widgets need to share the same data.
>
>In this case it provides us with an easy way to read the data from the entry widget.
>```python
>entered_text = self.item.get()
>```
>and write data back to the widget
>```python
>self.item.set("Some value")
>```

## Activating the buttons

Now we can activate each button in turn.
To do this we will specify a `command` which will be called when the button is pressed.
We can set the command when we create the buttons.


### The 'Add' button

First we will need to add items to our list.

Now we can add a method to take the value from the Entry (via `self.item`) and add it into the listbox.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add the current entry text to the list"""
    item = self.item.get()
    if item:
        self.list.insert(tk.END, item)
        self.item.set("")
```

Study the above code.
We are getting the text from the `tk.Entry` widget (via the `tk.StringVar` object).
If it contains an empty string, we ignore it and do nothing.
If it has a value, we call the `tk.Listbox.insert()` method to add our value to the *end* of the list.
We then set the `tk.StringVar` to an empty string to clear the added value from entry widget.

So far, this new `add` method will never be called.
So we *update* the existing add button by adding a `command` argument.

```python
self.add_btn = tk.Button(
    text="Add", 
    font=large, 
    command=self.add
)
```

This means that clicking the add button will now call our function. 

The final code looks like this:

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 18)
large = ('Helvetica', 24)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Shopping List')

        # the current/new item
        self.item = tk.StringVar()

        # create widgets
        self.label = tk.Label(
            text='My awesome shopping list app', 
            font=large
        )
        self.list = tk.Listbox(
            selectmode=tk.SINGLE, 
            font=small, 
            width=30
        )
        self.entry = tk.Entry(
            font=small, 
            width=30, 
            textvariable=self.item
        )
        self.add_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Add", 
            font=large, 
            command=self.add
        )
        self.update_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Update", 
            font=large
        )
        self.delete_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Delete", 
            font=large
        )

        # position widgets
        self.label.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=0, 
            column=0, 
            columnspan=2
        )
        self.entry.grid(
            padx=20, 
            row=1, 
            column=0
        )
        self.list.grid(
            padx=20, 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=0, 
            rowspan=3
        )
        self.add_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            pady=20, 
            row=2, 
            column=1
        )
        self.update_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            row=3, 
            column=1
        )
        self.delete_btn.grid(
            sticky="nsew", 
            padx=(0, 20), 
            pady=20, 
            row=4, 
            column=1
        )

    def add(self):
        """Add the current entry text to the list"""
        item = self.item.get()
        if item:
            self.list.insert(tk.END, item)
            self.item.set("")

app = ShoppingList()
app.mainloop()
```

Now you should be able to add items to the list using the entry and the add button.

![Adding items]({{"assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_07.png" | relative_url }})

### The 'Delete' button

Now, let's update the delete button to call a new `delete` method.

```python
self.delete_btn = tk.Button(
    text="Delete", 
    font=large, 
    command=self.delete
)
```

Obviously, we need to define the new method.
The method needs to detect which list item is selected and to delete the appropriate item from the list.

```python
def delete(self):
    """Delete the currently selected item"""
    index = self.list.curselection()
    if index:
        self.list.delete(index[0])
```

Here we are using the `Listbox.curselection()` method.
This will return a `tuple` containing the indices of all selected items.
In our case, because we specified `selectmode=tk.SINGLE`, we know that this will either be empty or will contain a single value.
So we check first, to make sure we have an item selected before calling the `Listbox.delete()` method which does the job of removing the selected item from the listbox.

>When we have an item selected, the result of `Listbox.curselection()` is something like `(2,)` - i.e. a tuple, with a single element.
This is why we need to extract the actual `integer` (2) from the `tuple` using square bracket notation `index[0]`.

Try adding a few items to the list and delete specific items.
You should see that the selected item is always deleted.
If nothing is selected, nothing happens.

### The 'Update' button

Now, let's call a new `update` method from the update button `command`.

```python
self.update_btn = tk.Button(
    text="Update", 
    font=large, 
    command=self.update
)
```

The `update` method needs to read the value from the entry widget, detect which list item is selected and to update the appropriate item in the listbox with the new value.

```python
def update(self):
    """Update the currently selected item"""
    index = self.list.curselection()
    item = self.item.get()
    if index and item:
        self.list.delete(index[0])
        self.list.insert(index[0], item)
        self.item.set("")
```

Notice we test for both `index` and `item` together, so we only execute the block following the `if` statement if we have an item selected in the listbox widget (i.e. `self.list.curselection()` is not an empty list) and we also have new text in the entry widget (i.e. `self.item.get()` is not an empty string).

It turns out, that in order to update a value in the list, we actually need to delete it and insert a new value.
This is no problem. 
We just do it.

We also set the value of the entry widget to an empty string because the updated text has been absorbed and is no longer needed.

Try it. 
You should now be able to use the update button to replace a selected item with the entered text.

### Some final tweaks

Our app now pretty much does everything we need it to do.

One thing we can do is help a user who wants to edit a spelling error in an item by prefilling the entry widget with the selected item value when the user selects an item.

To do this, we need to register code (an event handler) and bind it to the `<<ListboxSelect>>` event.
We can do this by calling the `bind()` method on the list widget.

Add this to the `__init__` method, after you have created the listbox.

```python
# events
self.list.bind("<<ListboxSelect>>", self.select)
```

Now, the `self.select` method will be called whenever we change the selection in the listbox.
The method will be passed an event object as an argument which can be used to determine the details of what happened.
In our case, we don't need any of this information, we can simply access the listbox directly to find out which item has been selected.

We can define the `select` method as follows:

```python
def select(self, event):
    """Update the entry widget with the selected item"""
    index = self.list.curselection()
    if index:
        item = self.list.get(index)
        if item:
            self.item.set(item)
```

It should be fairly familiar. 
All we are doing is finding the right item in the list widget, then we get its value and use it to set the value of the entry widget (via our `self.item` attribute).
The event will trigger when deselecting too.
We need to be careful to ensure that both an item has been selected and that the item contains text. 

>We could use the new assignment expressions (the *"walrus operator"*) for a neater implementation.
>
>```python
>def select(self, event):
>    """Update the entry widget with the selected item"""
>    if index := self.list.curselection():
>        if item := self.list.get(index[0]):
>            self.item.set(item)
>```
>I actually quite like this.

Now we also want to add the following line to the `delete` method to clear the entry if the selected item is deleted.

```python
self.item.set("")
```

That's it.
Here's the final code.

```python
import tkinter as tk

small = ('Helvetica', 18)
large = ('Helvetica', 24)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title('My Shopping List')

        # the current/new item
        self.item = tk.StringVar()

            font=large, 
            command=self.delete
        )

## Compound widgets and UI design

We have built a working shopping list application which allows us to manage a list of items.
We implemented features which allowed us to add new items, edit and delete existing items and in the challenges (as shown in the solution video) allowed our list to be saved to a file when the application was closed and loaded when the application was opened.

![the story so far]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/basic/step_07.png" | relative_url }})

Our application is functional but the interface is neither intuitive nor convenient.
So, we will redesign our application with a more advanced user interface.

Consider the `update` functionality.
In order to edit an item we need to go through four steps and requires switching from mouse to keyboard and back to mouse:

1. select the item to edit
1. select the entry field
1. type a new value
1. click the 'Update' button

This is not ideal. 

>It is possible to use the `tab` key (usually near `Q` and `Caps Lock`) to navigate the widgets without the mouse.
Using the spacebar will click buttons.
But, even with this convenience, the interface is still 'clunky'.

Even simply deleting an item from the list requires two steps:

1. Select the item
1. Click the 'Delete' button

Adding an item is surprisingly complicated:

1. Select the entry field
1. Type a new value
1. Click the 'Add' button

All this adds up to a poor user experience.
Anything we can do to improve this (even just a tiny bit) will help our users to be more productive.

## We can do better

Let's reimagine the shopping list application. 
A key feature we would like to have is the ability to select an item from the list and edit it directly, in place.
Perhaps we can use `tk.Entry` widgets to enable this?

Another feature we would like is to be able to simply press enter when adding or editing an item to trigger the action.
We can bind keyboard events to event handlers.

Finally, it would be nice to have a delete button next to every item so we can easily delete an item with one click.
So, each `tk.Entry` widget needs an associated `tk.Button`.

Fundamentally, the `tk.Listbox` widget doesn't allow us to do this.
All it can do is present a list.
There is no way to add anything other than simple text into a listbox widget.
So, we will replace our Listbox with a `tk.Frame` (basically a container widget).
This will allow us to build dynamic content and place it inside the frame.

<table class="app">
    <tr><th></th><th>1</th><th>2</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <th>1</th><td style="text-align: center;" colspan=2>Shopping List</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td class="entry">tk.Entry</td>
        <td style="width: 20px">Add</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td colspan=2 style="background-color: #aaa; height: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">
            tk.Frame
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td></td>
        <td>Clear</td>
    </tr>    
</table>

Our new design includes five widgets in a two by four grid.
In the top row we have a simple `tk.Label` spanning two columns.
The second row has a `tk.Entry` and `tk.Button` to allow users to add new items.
The `tk.Frame` takes up the third row, spanning both columns.
Underneath the frame, we have also added a `tk.Button` in the second column to allow the user to clear the entire list.
Everything else, including editing and deleting items, will happen within the frame.
So our table of widgets looks like this:

| widget    | row | column | rowspan | columnspan |
|:----------|:---:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| label     | 0   | 0      | -       | 2          |
| add_entry | 1   | 0      | -       | -          |
| add_btn   | 1   | 1      | -       | -          |
| frame     | 2   | 0      | -       | 2          |
| clear_btn | 3   | 1      | -       | -          |

Just as in the previous design, we can build these widgets in the application constructor method (`ShoppingList.__init__()`).
We first need to create the data and widgets and then we place them using `grid()` and the values in the above table.
We can begin with something like this:

> Start a new file for this (obviously?).

```python
import tkinter as tk

font = ('Helvetica', 20)

class ShoppingList(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("Shopping List")

        # variables
        self.new_item = tk.StringVar()

        # create widgets
        self.label = tk.Label(
            text="Shopping List", 
            font=font
        )

        self.entry = tk.Entry(
            textvariable=self.new_item, 
            width=30, 
            font=font
        )

        self.add_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Add", 
            command=self.add, 
            font=font
        )

        self.frame = tk.Frame(
            bg="#aaa"
        )

        self.clear_btn = tk.Button(
            text="Clear", 
            command=self.clear, 
            font=font
        )

        # layout widgets
        self.label.grid(columnspan=2, pady=(10, 0))
        self.entry.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky="nesw")
        self.add_btn.grid(row=1, column=1, sticky="nesw")
        self.frame.grid(sticky="nesw", columnspan=2)
        self.clear_btn.grid(column=1, sticky="nesw")

    def add(self):
        print('add command')

    def clear(self):
        print('clear command')

app = ShoppingList()
app.mainloop()
```

The result shouldn't be surprising, the frame widget has no contents and so takes up no space by default.

![step_01a]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_01a.png" | relative_url }})

Try changing the size of the window. 
Notice that the widgets don't respond.
They just retain their original size and position.

![step_01b]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_01b.png" | relative_url }})

When we increase the size of the window, we are creating extra space in the interface.
By default, none of the rows or columns will take this space.

### Flexible rows and columns

In order to allow our GUI to stretch to fit the window, we need to specify which rows and columns should be given the extra space.

We can do this by calling `widget.rowconfigure()` and `widget.columnconfigure()`.

In this case, we want row 2 (containing the frame) to be given all the extra vertical space.
Also column 0 (containing the entry and frame) should be given all the extra horizontal space.

We can specify this at the end of our `__init__` method.

```python
# configure rows and columns
self.rowconfigure(2, weight=1)
self.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

Now you should see that the GUI stretches to fit the size of the window.

>We set the background colour of the frame to make it clear what is happening.

However, the empty frame still takes up no height by default.
We can fix this by setting a minimum size for the main window as follows (again, in the `__init__` method).

```python
self.minsize(500, 500)
```

Here we are setting the minimum height to 500px and our interface stretches accordingly.
The minimum width is also set. 
This has no effect on the default size since the entry and the buttons take up space by default.
However, you should find that the window cannot now be shrunk beyond these limits.

![step_01c]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_01c.png" | relative_url }})

Great, we have a nice starting point for building a decent shopping list implementation.
Now we need to activate some of the familiar functionality.

## Adding items

When the user enters a value into the entry widget and clicks the 'Add' button, we want to see the entered item appear inside our frame and the entry widget should be cleared.

We will begin by experimenting with inserting simple `tk.Label` widgets dynamically to represent the items in our list.

Update the `add` method as follows:

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    item = self.new_item.get()
    if item:
        label = tk.Label(text=item, font=font)
        label.grid()
        self.new_item.set("")
```

Running the application and adding a few items to the list reveals that the new label widgets are being appended to the end of the main window (inside the first column).

![step_02a]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_02a.png" | relative_url }})

This is not good!
We want the system to create the label *inside* our frame.
To do this we need to pass in `self.frame` as the first argument to the `tk.Label` constructor.

Update the `add` method with this.

```python
label = tk.Label(self.frame, text=item, font=font)
```

>All widgets take this optional `parent` argument.
Until now, we have been creating all our widgets inside the top level window. 
We didn't need to manage any nesting because this is the default behaviour.
>
>Its good practice to always provide a `parent` widget (or top-level window).

Now, when we add items, they are inserted inside the frame.

![step_02b]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_02b.png" | relative_url }})

>This is unexpected.
The labels are clearly center aligned but they are not taking the full width of the frame.

There are a few issues we need to sort out here. 
We want the labels to have a white background and the label text should be left aligned.

We can configure the labels easily enough by setting `anchor` (to left align the text) and `bg` (the background colour).
See the [documentation for labels]({{ "https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/label.html" | relative_url }}) for details.

```python
label = tk.Label(
    self.frame, 
    text=item, 
    font=font, 
    anchor=tk.W, 
    bg="white"
)
```

Plus we need to set the `sticky` attribute when calling grid to make the label stretch to take the full width.

```python
label.grid(sticky="nesw")
```

![step_02c]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_02c.png" | relative_url }})

OK, nearly there.
The labels are placed within the first (and only) column of the frame.
But the column doesn't cover the entire width of the frame.
In fact, it's taking up the minimum possible space within the frame.

If we want to configure the column to take up all the available space, we need to specify this when we configure the frame.

Add this to the end of your `__init__` method.

```python
self.frame.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

This tells the frame that its first (and only) column should be given all the extra space available inside the parent frame.
The GUI should now resize well.

![step_02d]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_02d.png" | relative_url }})

>feel free to experiment with formatting the padding, colours and fonts of the various widgets.

Finally, we want to trigger the `add` method whenever the return key is pressed *inside* the entry widget. 
We can do this with an additional line of code at the end of the `__init__` method. 

```python
# events
self.entry.bind("<Return>", lambda e: self.add())
```

The code is *binding* our `add` method to the `<Return>` event of the `self.entry` widget.
Basically, this will automatically call the `add` method whenever the return key is pressed from inside the widget.

>We are wrapping our function call in a `lambda` function.
>```python
>lambda e: self.add()
>```
>This is shorthand for a named function like this:
>```python
>my_event_handler(e):
>   self.add()
>```
>We could have declared the above function and bound it to the `<Return>` event like this.
>```python
>self.entry.bind("<Return>", my_event_handler)
>```
>The only reason we need to do this wrapping is because we want to ignore the argument (`e`) passed into the event handler by `tkinter`.
>This allows our `add` method to remain unchanged, taking no arguments.

## Clearing the list

To clear the list we will need to remove the label widgets from the application.
We can do this by calling the `destroy()` method on each label in turn.
However, we don't currently have any way to do this for our label widgets because we don't have a reference to them.  We need to retain a reference to the labels we are adding so we can call the `destroy()` method on each of them.

In the `__init__` method, create a new `self.items` attribute to store the label widgets in a list.
You can add this in the section we labelled with the comment `'# variables'`.

```python
self.items = []
```

Now, whenever we add a new item, we should also append it to the new list.
Insert this single line into the `add` method to do this.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    item = self.new_item.get()
    if item:
        label = tk.Label(
            self.frame, 
            text=item, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.items.append(label) # <- this
        label.grid(sticky="news")
        self.new_item.set("")
```

Now, every time we add a new item, the resulting label widget will be added to our `self.items` list and will be available to our code.
To clear the list, we should be able to loop over `self.items` and call `destroy()` on each label in turn before replacing the list with an empty one. 

Let's do this in our `clear` method.

```python
def clear(self):
    for label in self.items:
        label.destroy()
    self.items = []
```

Try it. 
You should now be able to clear the list by clicking the 'Clear' button.

## An 'empty list' message

You might notice that the frame doesn't know how to resize itself when the list is cleared.
We can fix this with an 'empty list' message similar to our command line equivalent.
We will add a new label which we will only show when the list is empty.

>We can create widgets behind the scenes and show/hide them as we please.
>Using `grid()` and `grid_remove()` is one way to do this.
>`grid_remove()` will remove the widget from the grid without destroying the widget.

To do this we can begin by creating a label along with the other *widget creation* code in the `__init__` method.
We pass the frame as the parent, just like we did with our item labels.

```python
self.empty_label = tk.Label(
    self.frame, 
    text="\nThe list is empty\nadd some items to begin.\n", 
    font=font
)
```

>Our `self.empty_label` widget will be used only when the list is empty.

With the *layout* code in the `__init__` method, we can call `grid()` on our label with parameters to initialise it's layout.

```python
self.empty_label.grid(sticky="nesw", padx=50, pady=50)
```

>Calling `grid()` registers the widget in the app layout.

Now running the app shows the `empty_label` widget inside our frame.

![step_03a]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_03a.png" | relative_url }})

But the label should disappear when we add our first item.

When we add an item, in our `add` method, we need to remove our `empty_label` widget **without** destroying it.
We do this by calling the `grid_remove()` method.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    item = self.new_item.get()
    if item:
        label = tk.Label(
            self.frame, 
            text=item, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.items.append(label)
        label.grid(sticky="news")
        self.new_item.set("")
        self.empty_label.grid_remove() # <- new
```

Calling `grid_remove()` on a widget simply removes it from the grid layout, so it disappears. 
Although it still exists and its grid parameters are remembered, its just not shown.
It can be shown again, in its correct position by calling `grid()` on it.

>Compare this to `destroy()` which actually removes the widget from the app entirely.

Subsequently, when the list is cleared, we can call `grid()` without parameters and the geometry manager will remember where it should be positioned.


```python
def clear(self):
    for label in self.items:
        label.destroy()
    self.items = []
    self.empty_label.grid() # <- new
```

>`grid_forget()` acts in a similar way to `grid_remove()` but *forgets* the grid parameters.

Now you should find that adding and removing items works fine and our message shows whenever the list is empty.

## Deleting an item

To delete an individual item in our original application, the user needed to first select an item and then click the generic delete button.
We can improve this by adding a small delete button to every item.
In this way, the user simply clicks the appropriate delete button to remove an item.

For this, we could manage a list of buttons along with our list of labels but this would be complicated. Its much nicer (and perhaps easier) to develop a custom widget.

### A custom widget

We will design our own custom `ShoppingItem` widget to represent an item in our list.
The widget will consist of a `tk.Label` containing the text of the item and a `tk.Button` which will allow us to delete the item.

<table class="app">
    <tr>
        <td class="entry">item_label</td>
        <td style="width: 10px">×</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This is known as a compound widget.
We will insert multiple instances of our `ShoppingItem` widget into the container frame to represent our list.

<table class="app">
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;" colspan=2>Shopping List</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="entry"></td>
        <td style="width: 20px">Add</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan=2 style="padding: 2px">
            <table style="width: 100%">
                <tr>
                    <td class="entry">apples</td>
                    <td style="width: 10px">×</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="entry">bananas</td>
                    <td style="width: 10px">×</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="entry">cherries</td>
                    <td style="width: 10px">×</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Clear</td>
    </tr>
    
</table>

Each time the user adds a new item, we will insert a new `ShoppingItem` widget (instead of the `tk.Label`) into the frame.
Each `ShoppingItem` will be wrapped in it's own `tk.Frame` so it only takes a single column within the main `tk.Frame`.

We can update our `add` method in anticipation.
Replacing the `tk.Label` with a `ShoppingItem` widget.
This is what it currently looks like.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    item = self.new_item.get()
    if item:
        label = tk.Label(
            self.frame, 
            text=item, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        label.grid(sticky="nesw")
        self.items.append(label)
        self.new_item.set("")
        self.empty_label.grid_remove()
```

To create an instance of our new `ShoppingItem` widget we need to replace this code.

```python
label = tk.Label(
    self.frame, 
    text=item, 
    font=font, 
    anchor=tk.W, 
    bg="white"
)
```

Obviously we don't want to call the `ShoppingItem` widget *`label`*.
It makes sense to call it something like *`item`*.
But we already have a variable called *`item`* within the function.

So we need to refactor. 

>It's always a good idea to refactor your variable names when something like this happens.
Avoid names like *`item2`* or meaningless names.
Variables should always be named in a way that feels natural.

In this case, the value we get from the entry widget is renamed to *`text`* and the widget is renamed to *`item`*.

>You may have better ideas.

So we can update our method to this.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    text = self.new_item.get()
    if text:
        item = ShoppingItem(self.frame, text=text)
        item.grid(sticky="nesw")
        self.items.append(item)
        self.new_item.set("")
        self.empty_label.grid_remove()
```

Note that we changed five lines and that we are presuming an API for our `ShoppingItem` class constructor method.
We are assuming that we will set all the label parameters within the widget constructor method.
So all the widget needs to know is where it should place itself (`self.frame`) and the label text it should use (`text=text`).

Now we need to define the widget class itself.
We will extend the `tk.Frame` class to do this, so our widget with *be* a kind of `tk.Frame`.
We will start by simply adding a label and a button and calling `grid()` on both.

```python
class ShoppingItem(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, text):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.label = tk.Label(
            self, 
            text=text, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.button = tk.Button(self, text='×', font=font)
        self.label.grid()
        self.button.grid()
```

> The button text is a single utf-8 multiplication symbol, `'×'`.

So basically our new widget *is* a `tk.Frame`.
It's a customised `tk.Frame` that automatically places some widgets inside itself.
This is why we can pass `self` into the label and button constructors as the `parent` argument. 
Because `self` *is* the frame which wraps our custom widget.

Try adding a few items and we can see that each of our `ShoppingItem` widgets is self-contained.
But the label and button widgets are not positioned how we want them.

![step_04a]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_04a.png" | relative_url }})

We need to use the `column` and `row` arguments to place the label and button on a single row within our custom widget.

```python
class ShoppingItem(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, text):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.label = tk.Label(
            self, 
            text=text, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.button = tk.Button(self, text='×', font=font)
        self.label.grid(row=0, column=0)
        self.button.grid(row=0, column=1)
```

![step_04b]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_04b.png" | relative_url }})


Much better, but we have a familiar problem. 
We should tell the `ShoppingList` widget to stretch column 0 when there is extra space.
We do this with `columnconfigure`.

```python
class ShoppingItem(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, text):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.label = tk.Label(
            self, 
            text=text, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.button = tk.Button(self, text='×', font=font)
        self.label.grid(row=0, column=0)
        self.button.grid(row=0, column=1)
        self.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```
![step_04c]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_04c.png" | relative_url }})

Great, but the label is positioned in the middle of the grid cell by default.
We forgot to tell the label to expand to fill its grid cell.

Add the `sticky` argument to the call to `self.label.grid()`

```python
class ShoppingItem(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, text):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.label = tk.Label(
            self, 
            text=text, 
            font=font, 
            anchor=tk.W, 
            bg="white"
        )
        self.button = tk.Button(self, text='×', font=font)
        self.label.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="nesw")
        self.button.grid(row=0, column=1)
        self.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

![step_04d]({{ "assets/img/tkinter/compound/step_04d.png" | relative_url }})

OK, now we have a sensible looking shopping list with buttons to delete each item.

As we know, we need to set a `command` argument on the button to a method which will be triggered when the button is pressed.
We need a method that will delete the `ShoppingItem` instance from the application.
Let's call it `self.delete`.
Update the button as follows:

```python
self.button = tk.Button(
    self, 
    text='×', 
    font=font, 
    command=self.delete
)
```

> This is an update to the existing code, wrapping the arguments over multiple lines and adding the `command` argument.

Now we can add a `ShoppingItem.delete()` method to test it works.
We'll start by seeing if we can print the item label text when the delete button is clicked.

```python
def delete(self):
    print(self.label['text'])
```
>It turns out we can access the text of a label with dictionary-like indexing.

If you try this, you should find that it works perfectly.

### Refactoring

Now we need to actually trigger the removal of the list item.
This is interesting because we know the `ShoppingList` class is responsible for managing it's `self.items` list.
So it should be responsible for doing the delete operation.
But we are triggering the delete operation from the button in the `ShoppingItem` class.

>Pay attention here.
>We are about to refactor our code to make the task easy.
>
>Re-read the above paragraph.
>If you understand what we do next, then you understand something important.

So when the delete button is pressed, our `ShoppingItem` instance (which represents `'apples'` for example and has the `delete` button built in) needs to inform the parent `ShoppingList` instance (the entire application) that *it* (the `ShoppingItem` representing 'apples') should be deleted.

Put another way, rather than destroying itself, the `ShoppingItem` is better off calling something like a `ShoppingList.delete()` method and passing itself (literally `self`) as the argument. 

>If the `ShoppingItem` tried to delete itself by calling `self.destroy()` it would leave a reference to itself in the `ShoppingList.items` attribute.
There are bad ways to do this that would work.

To enable this, we need to refactor our code slightly.
Our `ShoppingItem` instances need access to the parent `ShoppingList` in order to call the proposed `ShoppingList.delete()` method.

So the first thing we will do is change the `ShoppingList.add()` method so our `ShoppingList` passes a reference to itself into all the newly created `ShoppingItem` instances.

```python
def add(self):
    """Add a new item to the end of the list"""
    text = self.new_item.get()
    if text:
        item = ShoppingItem(self, text=text)
        item.grid(sticky="nesw")
        self.items.append(item)
        self.new_item.set("")
        self.empty_label.grid_remove()
```

>Notice the difference, we now pass `self` rather than `self.frame` into the `ShoppingItem` constructor.
So our items have access to the entire `ShoppingList` interface.

This change requires a small tweak to the first few lines of the `ShoppingItem` constructor.
Rather than receiving a `tk.Frame` instance, we now receive the `ShoppingList` instance which has the `self.frame` attribute.

```python
def __init__(self, shopping_list, text):
    super().__init__(shopping_list.frame)
    self.shopping_list = shopping_list
    self.label = tk.Label(
        self, 
        text=text, 
        font=font, 
        anchor=tk.W, 
        bg="white"
    )
    self.button = tk.Button(
        self, 
        text='×', 
        font=font, 
        command=self.delete
    )
    self.label.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="nesw")
    self.button.grid(row=0, column=1)
    self.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
```

We have renamed the `parent` argument to `shopping_list` to reflect the change.

>We now pass `shopping_list.frame` into the inherited `tk.Frame` constructor as the parent widget.
Remember, `ShoppingList.frame` is the `tk.Frame` widget where the `ShoppingItem` widgets live in the application.

The most important change (and the reason for the refactor) is that we can now store a reference to the `ShoppingList` as `self.shopping_list`.

Let's now update our `ShoppingItem.delete()` method to hand over responsibility to a proposed `ShoppingList.delete()` method.

```python
def delete(self):
    self.shopping_list.delete(self)
```

>This code is the `ShoppingItem.delete()` method, in a moment we will implement the `ShoppingList.delete()` method too. 

This is an important piece of code, it tells the application to 'delete this item', where 'this item' is `self`. 

>The clicked button is part of the `ShoppingItem` class.
>It has a reference to the parent application, so it can now easily request to be deleted.
>
>This is an important idea.
>Each part of the system has its own responsibilities.
>Only the `ShoppingList` class needs to know how to delete an item from the list.

Let's implement the `ShoppingList.delete()` method.
In order to delete an item, we need to call `destroy()` on the widget itself and remove the widget from the list.

```python
def delete(self, item):
    self.items.remove(item)
    item.destroy()
```

>Remember, this goes on the `ShoppingList` class

We have implemented a method that takes an argument called `item`.
We use the [list.remove()](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) method to find and remove the item.

>If the item was not on the list, this would raise an error. 
However, this situation will never arise.

Finally we call `item.destroy()` to actually delete the widget from the application entirely.
You should now be able to delete any item by clicking it's delete button.

One last thing we should do is check to see if we have removed the last item.
If we leave the list empty, then we should show the `self.empty_label` widget.

```python
def delete(self, item):
    self.items.remove(item)
    item.destroy()
    if not self.items:
        self.empty_label.grid()
```


OK, we have built the main application.
Here are a few challenges to test how well you understand what we have done.
