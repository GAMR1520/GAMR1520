title: Unit testing with python
description: Unit tests allow us to create a specification for functions and to test whether the function does what we want it to do under various circumstances. For example, we can put different data into a function and confirm that the output is what we want.

{% assign challenges = site.challenges | where:"lab", 4.1 | sort: "id" %}

This lab exercise will explore some simple approaches with [the unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) from the standard library.
In particular, we will explore how to create [unittest.TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase) instances with simple test methods.

Unit testing approaches have many advantages:

- They can document how some code should behave.
- They can be used to find bugs (known as regressions) introduced to previously working code.
- They can confirm that code does what it should do, so you know when to stop coding.

{% include toc.md %}


## A simple example

The best way to understand testing is to consider some real scenarios.
We will begin with some code to test.

```python
def times_table(arg):
    return tuple(range(0, arg * 12, arg))
```

> make a copy of this in a module called *times_table.py*.

The intent is that the function should return a tuple containing the given times table from *1 x arg* to *12 x arg*.
However, the above code has two bugs which we can see if we exercise the function.

```python
for i in range(1, 13):
    print(times_table(i))
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22)
(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33)
(0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44)
(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55)
(0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66)
(0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77)
(0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88)
(0, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99)
(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110)
(0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121)
(0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132)
```
{: .small-margin}

The result should begin at *1 x arg* but it always begins at zero.
It should end at *12 x arg* but the last value is *11 x arg*.

> This is a classic *off by one* error which occurs in two places in the code.

Although this may be an easy issue to spot, we can write some tests which will catch the problem for us.

### Our first test

We want to create some code to test the *times_table.py* module.
To create a test we need to import the `unittest.TestCase` class and inherit from it.

> Inheriting means we are creating a customised version of the `unittest.TestCase` class.
As we shall see, our class will inherit capabilities which make testing easy.

```python
import unittest

from times_table import times_table

class TestTimesTable(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_one(self):
        msg = "One times table isn't correct"
        expected = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
        actual = times_table(1)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Any method that begins with the word `'test'` is treated as a test.
Our class has one test method.

The test creates an `expected` variable and assigns a tuple literal containing the integers `1` through `12`.
This is the result we *want* from our function.
It then passes the value `1` into our function to create the `actual` result.
This is what the function really produces.

The test includes an *assertion* using `self.assertEqual` (this is a method inherited from the `TestCase` class) which *asserts* the the `actual` value *should be* the same as the `expected` value.
The test will pass if the values are identical.
It will fail if they are different.

Finally, the code calls the `unittest.main()` method.
This is what triggers the tests to run.
In this case we only have one test, if there were more tests, even in multiple classes, this method call would run them all in turn.

Save the above code as *test_times_table.py* and run the module.

> **ERROR MESSAGES ARE GOOD**

> When working with tests and with python in general it's important to realise that *errors are your friends*.
> When we get errors, we should be happy.
> Because without the errors we would be lost in chaos with no idea what to do.
> See [learning from errors]({{"references/errors" | relative_url }}) for more on this.
>
> Nobody writes perfect code.
> Finding bugs can be a painful process.
> Our error messages show us exactly what went wrong.
> They often make solving a problem a lot easier.
> At least they help us to solve the right problem.
>
> We write tests precisely because we want to raise errors if something doesn't work.


The output looks like this.

```

The output is a bit confusing, but we should be able to tell that the test is failing.

Starting at the top, the output begins with a summary showing the results of each test.

```plaintext

```

In our case, we have only one test and it failed. 

> For multiple tests, there would be more characters.
e.g. `'FF.E'` would indicate two failures followed by a pass, followed by an error.

This is followed by information about each failed test in turn.
In our case, there is only one failure report.

```plaintext

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

We can see the code raised an `AssertionError` with the message *Tuples differ: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) != (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)*.
It goes on to provide even more detail about the difference between the expected and actual result and ends with our custom error message *One times table isn't correct*.


The output ends with another summary showing how many tests were executed and how many failures (and errors) there were.

```plaintext
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1)
```

Let's tweak our function to fix the first error.

```python
def times_table(arg):
    return tuple(range(arg, arg * 12, arg))
```

> We replaced a `0` with `arg` so the result should no longer start with zero.

Now running the tests produces a slightly different error message.

```plaintext
AssertionError: Tuples differ: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) != (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)

Second tuple contains 1 additional elements.
First extra element 11:
12

- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
+ (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
?                                   ++++
 : One times table isn't correct
```

The error is telling us that our `expected` tuple contains an extra value and it's pointing to the exact problem. 

If we fix this final issue, then our test passes.

```python
def times_table(arg):
    return tuple(range(arg, arg * 13, arg))
```

> We've extended `arg * 12` to `arg * 13` because the range constructor end value is exclusive, just like slicing.

Execute the test and you should see that the output for passing tests is much quieter.

```plaintext
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK
```

The summary shows that one test was executed and it passed.
The single dot `.` on the first line represents the single passing test.

We can produce slightly more output if we set the `verbosity` to `2` in our test code.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
test_with_one (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```
{: .small-margin}

The single dot has now been replaced by a more verbose output which lists each test by name.
There is still only one passing test, but this output can be useful as a summary of exactly what is passing and what is failing.


### A few more tests

So, we can see that tests provide concrete feedback which will show us exactly where the problem is.

> This is particularly useful if we have complex code that is often changed.
> In complex code, every change that adds a new feature has the potential to break an existing feature.
> By writing a decent set of tests, we can test our code every time we make a change to confirm we haven't broken it.
>
> Imagine you were responsible for maintaining a library that was used by hundreds of developers. 
> No matter how simple the code, when releasing an update any change to the behaviour would break your users code and prevent them from using the new update.
> So a good testing strategy is essential.

Now, our function seems to work, we can add a few additional test cases to specify what should happen with various values including extreme values and error values.

First, we can add something very similar for `2` and `12`.

```python
import unittest

from times_table import times_table

class TestTimesTable(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_one(self):
        msg = "One times table isn't correct"
        expected = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
        actual = times_table(1)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_two(self):
        msg = "Two times table isn't correct"
        expected = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)
        actual = times_table(2)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_twelve(self):
        msg = "Twelve times table isn't correct"
        expected = (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144)
        actual = times_table(12)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
test_with_one (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_twelve (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_two (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
{: .small-margin}

Great, everything is working as we want.

> Notice the order in which the tests run is alphanumeric.

We wrote a few tests to define the correct behaviour when the function is passed appropriate data.
This is called testing *the happy path*.
If they are important, we can also consider error states.

### Testing bad input

Now, perhaps we confirm that our function raises a `TypeError` if a string is passed.
We can add a test to check this.

```python
import unittest

from times_table import times_table

class TestTimesTable(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_one(self):
        msg = "One times table isn't correct"
        expected = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
        actual = times_table(1)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_two(self):
        msg = "Two times table isn't correct"
        expected = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)
        actual = times_table(2)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_twelve(self):
        msg = "Twelve times table isn't correct"
        expected = (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144)
        actual = times_table(12)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_hello(self):
        msg = "'hello' should raise TypeError"
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError, msg=msg):
            times_table('hello')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
test_with_hello (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_one (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_twelve (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_two (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.007s

OK
```
{: .small-margin}

So it turns out this is already true and the test also passes.

> This test will need to be changed later.

### Adapting to changing requirements

Now we want to allow our function to accept numeric strings.
So we add another test which passes `'10'` into our function and expects it to work.

```python
import unittest

from times_table import times_table

class TestTimesTable(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_one(self):
        msg = "One times table isn't correct"
        expected = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
        actual = times_table(1)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_two(self):
        msg = "Two times table isn't correct"
        expected = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24)
        actual = times_table(2)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_twelve(self):
        msg = "Twelve times table isn't correct"
        expected = (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144)
        actual = times_table(12)
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

    def test_with_hello(self):
        msg = "'hello' should raise TypeError"
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError, msg=msg):
            times_table('hello')

    def test_with_numeric_string(self):
        msg = "'10' should be interpreted as 10"
        expected = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120)
        actual = times_table('10')
        self.assertEqual(actual, expected, msg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext

```
{: .small-margin}

Strictly speaking the `test_with_numeric_string()` test didn't fail, it raised an error.
Our function raised an exception which prevented the test from completing.

The new test passes a numeric string into our function which raises the same `TypeError` as any string would.

```python
actual = times_table('10')
```

The error comes from passing a string into the `range()` function which only accepts integers.
We can fix this, and implement the new feature, by converting our `arg` into an integer before we pass it into `range()`.


```python
def times_table(arg):
    arg = int(arg)
    return tuple(range(0, arg * 12, arg))
```

Now we can run our tests again and get this output.

```plaintext
test_with_hello (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ERROR
test_with_numeric_string (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_one (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_twelve (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok

    arg = int(arg)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.002s

FAILED (errors=1)
```

Study the output.
You should see that the new test `test_with_numeric_string()` passed.

Its `test_with_hello()` that raises an error.
This is because we cannot convert `'hello'` into an integer.
Because a string is an acceptable type (some strings can be converted to integers), the error is actually a `ValueError` not a `TypeError`.

At this point we think...
It seems reasonable that passing a non-numeric string is actually a `ValueError` because a numeric string is now allowed.
So we can change our test accordingly.

> Changing tests vs changing code is a tricky choice requiring careful thought.

The updated test looks like this:

```python
    def test_with_hello(self):
        msg = "'hello' should raise ValueError"
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError, msg=msg):
            times_table('hello')
```

with this change, we now have five passing tests.

```plaintext
test_with_hello (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_numeric_string (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_one (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_twelve (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok
test_with_two (__main__.TestTimesTable) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.005s

OK
```

## A test-driven approach

OK, so the simple example above demonstrates the basic principles of the `unittest.TestCase()` API.
Rather than writing tests for existing code, we can start with a test and write the code necessary for the tests to pass.
Our tests can explain what *should* happen.
As we develop our code, we can handle each test one at a time.
Once all the tests pass then the code should be complete.

We will create a very simple example and walk though it slowly, one step at a time.

> In a real situation you will often solve many issues in one pass, here we will literally try to hit every error possible.

Start by creating a *test_coordinate.py* file and enter the following code.

```python
import unittest

from coordinate import Coordinate


class TestCoordinate(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_values(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20)
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 10)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 20)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

The above code is familiar.
We can see that it is testing a `Coordinate` class like we dealt with when we introduced [object-oriented python]({{"exercises/3.1" | relative_url}}).

The test code gives us some important clues about what we need to do to make the tests pass.

> Test code always gives everything required to make the tests pass.
> Though, just like any code, tests can be poorly written and not very useful.

### Checking the imports

If we attempt to run the tests (i.e. execute the `test_coordinate` module) we get an immediate `ModuleNotFoundError`.
```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/test_coordinate.py", line 3, in <module>
    from coordinate import Coordinate
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'coordinate'
``` 

This is because, even before the test code is executed, our `test_coordinate` module imports a `Coordinate` class (the capitalised name implies a class) from a `coordinate` module.

This means we need to define a `Coordinate` class within a `coordinate` module (i.e. a *coordinate.py* file within the same folder as the test code).


Within a new *coordinate.py* file, we can include a class definition for a `Coordinate` class, like this.

```python
class Coordinate:
    pass
```

> If the *coordinate.py* file existed but we didn't define the correct class then we would get an `ImportError` when the class wasn't found. 
```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/test_coordinate.py", line 3, in <module>
    from coordinate import Coordinate
ImportError: cannot import name 'Coordinate' from 'coordinate' (path/to/coordinate.py)
```

### Running the tests

With the `import` statement now working, our test code will be executed when we run the *test_coordinate.py* module. 
Initially, we get a failing test.

```plaintext
E
======================================================================
ERROR: test_values (__main__.TestCoordinate)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/test_coordinate.py", line 9, in test_values
    c = Coordinate(10, 20)
TypeError: Coordinate() takes no arguments

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (errors=1)
```

Notice the last line of output indicated our test not only failed but that our test code raised an error.

```plaintext
FAILED (errors=1)
```

We can see the error is pointing towards line 9, the first line of the `test_values` test. 

```plaintext
  File "path/to/test_coordinate.py", line 9, in test_values
    c = Coordinate(10, 20)
TypeError: Coordinate() takes no arguments
```

Our test assumes that our class has a constructor which takes two positional arguments.
Our class takes no constructor arguments (because it has no custom `__init__()` method).

So we should expand our code to accept two arguments into the constructor.

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        pass
```

Running the tests now produces a different error.

```plaintext
E
======================================================================
ERROR: test_values (__main__.TestCoordinate)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/test_coordinate.py", line 10, in test_values
    self.assertEqual(c.x, 10)
AttributeError: 'Coordinate' object has no attribute 'x'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (errors=1)
```

Again, the test output tells us exactly what is going wrong.
Our test includes an assertion to check that the instance attribute `x` is equal to `10`.
But the code raises an `AttributeError` because our instance doesn't have an `x` attribute.

We can update out `Coordinate.__init__()` method to assign the provided arguments to the `x` and `y` attributes.

> We pre-empted the next error here because lines 10 and 11 of the `test_coordinate` module are basically identical but line 11 is checking the value of the `y` instance attribute.

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

With this update, our test passes.
We can be sure that the `x` and `y` values are properly initialised.

### The full set of tests 

The `Coordinate` class is clearly more complicated than this basic test implies.
Here's the full suite of tests to capture the functionality described in previous exercises.

```python
import unittest

from coordinate import Coordinate


class TestCoordinate(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_values(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20)
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 10)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 20)

    def test_invertion(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20)
        c.invert()
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 20)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 10)

    def test_addition(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20) + Coordinate(20, 10)        
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 30)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 30)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20) - Coordinate(20, 10)        
        self.assertEqual(c.x, -10)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 10)

    def test_multiplication(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20) * Coordinate(20, 10)        
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 200)
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 200)

    def test_division(self):
        c = Coordinate(10, 20) / Coordinate(20, 10)        
        self.assertEqual(c.x, 0.5)
        self.assertEqual(c.y, 2)

    def test_str(self):
        cstr = str(Coordinate(10, 20))        
        self.assertEqual(cstr, "(10, 20)")

    def test_repr(self):
        crepr = repr(Coordinate(10, 20))        
        self.assertEqual(crepr, "Coordinate(x=10, y=20)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
