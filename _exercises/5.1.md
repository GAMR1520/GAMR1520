{% assign challenges = site.challenges | where:"lab", 5.1 | sort: "id" %}

## A basic HTML template

To use JavaScript in the browser, we first need to create an HTML document.
This is the file that the browser loads (usually from a remote server, but we will start by loading it locally).

> Obviously we can no longer use IDLE.
Make sure you are using [VSCode]({{"references/code-editor" | relative_url}}) or similar for this.
VSCode is an excellent choice for web development.

You should have already created a folder for this lab.
Open the folder in VSCode so that you can see the file manager.
In web development we will often have multiple files in a project. 
So, we should get into the habit of creating a folder for each project.

Create a folder called *basic_template*.
Within this folder, create a file called *index.html*.

>It is important that the file is created and named before this next step.
VSCode will detect that the file is an HTML file and give us a set of HTML template options.

Open the file and type `html`.
You should see a set of options appear.

![html template in vscode]({{"assets/img/week_5/html-template.png" | relative_url}})

Select the `html:5` option and press enter.

> This feature is known as [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) and is built into vscode by default.
> You will find that you can use it to save time and keystrokes. 
> You can type the colon and the five to limit the options, notice that when you type anything, similar options appear.
> If you choose the wrong option, just clear the content and try again.

The automatic HTML5 template generated looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

This is the HTML document that the browser will open, parse and render.
It contains two things, a *doctype* and an *html element*.

### The doctype

The *doctype* simply tells the browser which version of HTML to expect.
Basically, you need this at the top of every HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

> In previous eras, this was a much more complex aspect of web development.
Since HTML5 was released in 2008, the *doctype* declaration has become very simple.

### The `<html>` element


The *html* code itself consists of nested elements.
The first element is the `<html>` element and it is the only top-level element.
The `</html>` closing tag is always the last thing in the file.

The opening tag also includes a `lang="en"` attribute.

```html
<html lang="en">
```

This is always recommended, it indicates the main language of the content of the document.

Valid `<html>` elements can include only two elements, the `<head>` and the `<body>`.

#### The `<head>` element

In our template, the `<head>` looks like this.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
```

The `<head>` element is where we put information about the document.
For example, we have three `<meta>` elements providing *meta-data* about how this page should be interpreted.

> These meta-data are not important to understand, so don't worry about it if this is confusing.
> The first tells the browser that the file is *utf-8* encoded.
> The second is for older internet explorer browsers only, it tells them the document should be interpreted in the most modern compatibility mode available to the browser.
> The third element tells mobile browsers they should use the actual device width rather than simulating a larger device, which was the default behaviour when mobile browsers were new.
> These are good defaults, though older internet explorer browsers are now very rare so this can probably be dropped.

The final element is the `<title>` of the document.
This will not be visible in the page, but many browsers use this content to name the browser window or tab which is displaying the page.
Every document must have a `<title>` defined in the `<head>`.

> The first change you could make is to change the title of your document.

#### The `<body>` element

This is where all the visible content of the site must go.
Content nested inside the `<body>` element will be visible on the page (unless it is made invisible using *styles*).

In our template, the `<body>` element is empty.

```html
<body>

</body>
```

It's worth noting at this point that most elements in HTML have opening and closing tags like the `<title>`.

```html
<title>Document</title>
```

However, some elements (known as *void* elements) cannot contain any content.
These elements do not have a closing tag.
The `<meta>` element is a good example of this, but another common example is the `<img>` element.

```html
<img src="myImage.png" alt="the text is used if the image cannot be viewed">
```

With all elements, the attributes can determine how the element is rendered by the browser.

### Viewing the document and adding content

> We recommend using google chrome, simply because this is by far the most popular browser.

Your browser can run local files but the minimalist design of modern browsers means there may not be an obvious way.

The file can be opened in a browser by various means.

- Drag and drop the tab from vscode onto a browser tab.
- Select the file in your OS file manager and double-click.
- Use *ctrl + O* in google chrome and select your file.
- Use the vscode run menu (which should open a new browser window).

Once you open the file, you should see nothing.
Just a blank page.
The title (in my case "Document") will be visible in the browser tab. 

![html template in google chrome]({{"assets/img/week_5/blank-page.png" | relative_url}})

To add some content, we can update our HTML `<body>` with some content.

```html
<body>
    <h1>This is a document</h1>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
```

> I'm going to ignore the `<html>` and `<head>` elements to keep this simple, but don't delete them from your file.
You will need to replace your empty `<body>` element with the above code.

Return to your blank browser window and refresh the page (*ctrl + R*).
You should see the new content appears.

![hello world in google chrome]({{"assets/img/week_5/hello-world.png" | relative_url}})


## The Document Object Model

The first thing we will look at is the *Document Object Model* (the *DOM*).
The *DOM* is a data structure representing the HTML document.

When the browser loaded our document from the file, it built the *DOM*.
Critically, though our file is static, the *DOM* (which is initialised from the data in our file) is dynamic and can be changed.
We will use JavaScript to interact with the *DOM* and manipulate the data displayed in the browser.

We are going to take this one step at a time.
We will begin by viewing the *DOM* using the *browser developer tools*.
In your browser window, press *F12* to open the developer tools panel.

> There are other common ways to do this, e.g. right-click on the page and choose *inspect* to highlight a particular element within the DOM.

The developer tools panel will open, it may look slightly different from the image below.
Explore the options.
You should find a representation of the DOM in the *elements* tab.
It looks a lot like our document, with collapsible nested elements.
If you select an element, you should see it highlighted on the page.

![developer tools in google chrome]({{"assets/img/week_5/developer-tools.png" | relative_url}})

### What about JavaScript?

There is also a *console* tab. 
This is where we can enter JavaScript commands.
A lot like the interactive python prompt.

> The browser developer tools are very powerful and include many features that we will not talk about.
> The crucial features we will use are the *elements* tab (which gives us a view into the *DOM*) and the *console* (which allows us to execute JavaScript, see errors and write log messages from our code). 


Enter a JavaScript command into the console.

```js
alert('hello world');
```

![javascript hello world]({{"assets/img/week_5/js-hello-world.png" | relative_url}})

The `alert()` function is a crude way to send a message to users.
The user needs to dismiss the message by clicking *OK*.

Notice that, once the message is dismissed, the console shows the result of the function call.
In this case, the alert function does not return a value, so the result is `undefined`.
This is a value that represents no value, somewhat similar to `None` in python. 

### Literals

Just like python, JavaScript has literals.
We can enter a literal value into the console and it will evaluate to itself.
Try these commands in the console and see what you think.

Numbers are just numbers, there is no distinction between integers and floats.

```js
100;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
100
```
{:.small-margin}

Strings are strings, obvs.

```js
'hello world';
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'hello world'
```
{:.small-margin}

Booleans are lowercase (different from python - watch out for this).

```js
true;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
true
```
{:.small-margin}

### Variables and assignment

In each case above we created a value but we didn't keep a reference to it, so once it was outputted to the console, it was immediately garbage collected.

JavaScript has three kinds of variables, declared with the `var`, `let` and `const` keywords.

> The `var` keyword is best avoided for complex reasons.
> It is essentially a global variable and introduces more danger of creating naming clashes.
> The more tightly scoped `let` is always a better choice.
>
> You may see a lot of older code which uses `var` on the internet. 
> This is all from prior to 2015 and should be updated to use `const` and/or `let` as appropriate.

#### Using `const`

Using `const` declares a variable that cannot be reassigned, we use the `const` keyword and the `=` operator.

```js
const a = 1;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
undefined
```
{:.small-margin}

Now we have created a new constant `a` which is storing the value `1` for us.
The return value of the variable declaration is `undefined`.

Because we used `const` when we defined `a`, we cannot reassign it to another value.

```js
const a = 1;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
undefined
```
{:.small-margin}
```js
a = 'hello';
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
{:.small-margin}

> Strictly speaking, a variable declared with `const` is not guaranteed to be constant, but it will always point to the same object in memory.
> For example, an `Array` declared with `const` can have elements added and modified arbitrarily, but the variable is guaranteed to always point to the same `Array`.

#### Using `let`

Using `let` creates a more flexible variable.
If you need a variable that can be reassigned then you must use the `let` keyword to declare your variable.

When declaring variables it is considered good practice to **always** use `const` where possible and only use `let` when declaring a variable that needs to be reassigned.

> The following code may produce errors if `a` has already been declared as a `const` from above.
> Refreshing the page (with *ctrl + R*) will clear all your variables from memory so you can start again. 

```js
let a = 1;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
undefined
```
{:.small-margin}
```js
a = 2;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
2
```
{:.small-margin}

Again, the declaration returns `undefined`.
However, subsequent assignments do return the assigned value, so you will see output in the console for assignment.

Unlike `const`, it is not necessary to initialise a variable with a value when using `let`.

```js
let a;
```

In this case, the value `undefined` is automatically assigned.

Of course, just like python, JavaScript is dynamically typed.

```js
let a = 1;
a = 'hello';
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'hello'
```
{:.small-margin}


> JavaScript is forgiving.
> It will allow you to miss off the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword when defining a variable.
> In which case, it will use `var` by default which creates more danger of naming clashes.
> So it's a good idea to *always* explicitly declare your variables.
>
> We will see later that it is possible to activate *strict mode* in your javascript files to enforce good practice.

### Everything is an object

All values in JavaScript are objects, similar to python.
For example, we can see that a `Number` has the `toString` method.

```js
a = 1
a.toString()
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'1'
```
{:.small-margin}

Though the data model is very different from python.

> We will try to avoid going down this rabbit-hole.
For now, know that every object has a *prototype* and that the object/prototype relationship is a bit like the instance/class relationship in python.
In this case, the variable `a` has a *prototype* which implements the `Number` methods.
You can see it by inspecting the `__proto__` property.
```js
a.__proto__
```
When we ask our object `a` for the `toString` property, it finds it on it's *prototype*.

In JavaScript, simple `object` literals can be created and used a bit like python dictionaries.
We create them with curly braces.

```js
const obj = {
    message: 'hello world',
    value: 100
}
```

Notice that the object keys are not quoted strings like they would be in python.

> Objects are actually more similar to python classes, but we can skip the details for now.

We can access object properties using dot notation.

```js
obj.message
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'hello world'
```
{:.small-margin}

### Arrays

An `Array` is a special kind of object that acts a lot like a python list.
`Array` literals (like python lists) can be created using square brackets.

```js
const arr = ['hello world', 1];
```

...or we can use the `Array` constructor.

```js
const arr = new Array('hello world', 1);
```

We can access elements in an `Array` using square bracket notation.

```js
arr[0];
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'hello world'
```
{:.small-margin}

We can append to an array using [Array.push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push).

```js
arr.push('something else');
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
3
```
{:.small-margin}

The return value of the `Array.push()` method is the new length.

> check that the array has been modified.
Look up more about Arrays in [the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
For example, [Array.concat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) can be used to concatenate arrays. 


The console gives a nice interactive view of data structures like arrays and objects.
This can be very useful when a data structure contains a complex set of nested objects.

### DOM manipulation

Go back to the *elements* tab in the developer console.
Notice that the *DOM* elements are editable.
Try double-clicking on the various elements in the *DOM* or right-clicking and selecting the various options.

![Editing the DOM in the elements tab]({{"assets/img/week_5/editing-the-dom.png" | relative_url}})

Editing the content is easy and if you confirm an edit (usually by pressing enter, or by clicking away from the HTML editor) then the page will update accordingly.

> Meanwhile, our *index.html* document remains untouched and can be reloaded at any time using *ctrl + R*.

Similarly, we can use JavaScript to interact with the DOM.


In JavaScript, we interact with the *DOM* using the `document` object.
This is a built-in part of the browser context and basically represents the *DOM*.

#### Creating and inserting elements

Let's say we want to add a new paragraph like this.

> Don't add this into the HTML file, we will use JavaScript to insert the new element.

```html
<body>
    <h1>This is a document</h1>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <p>I'm a new paragraph!</p>
</body>
```

This requires three steps:

1. Create a `<p>` element
1. Set the content of the paragraph to `"I'm a new paragraph"`
1. Insert the new `<p>` element into the existing `<body>`.


First, we use [document.createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) to create the element.

```js
const p = document.createElement('p');
```

> Try inspecting the value of `p`.

Then we set the [textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) property of our newly created element.

```js
p.textContent = "I'm a new paragraph";
```

> Again, try inspecting the value of `p` now.

Notice, the new element is not in the page yet.

Finally, we [append](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append) the new element to the end of the [document.body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body).

```js
document.body.append(p);
```

You should see the element has appeared in the page and in the *elements* tab of the developer tools.

#### Accessing and editing elements

To edit a particular element, we first need to find it in the DOM.
There are a number of ways to do this.
In most cases, if you want to use JavaScript in a document for this kind of thing, then the easiest option is to give your element an `id` attribute.

Let's add a new element to our *index.html* file and give it the attribute `id="target"`.

```html
<body>
    <h1>This is a document</h1>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <p id="target">This content needs to change</p>
</body>
```

We want to get a reference to this element in JavaScript.
We can do this with [document.getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById).

```js
const element = document.getElementById('target');
```

> Try inspecting the value of the variable `element`.

We can read the existing [textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) of our element.

```js
element.textContent;
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
'This content needs to change'
```
{:.small-margin}

It's a simple matter to change the content.

```js
element.textContent = "That's much better!";
```

Once again, notice that both the *DOM* (in the *elements* tab) and the page have been updated.

### Scripts

It's about time we stopped messing with the console and wrote some code into a file.

> The console is an invaluable tool in JavaScript development.
As an interactive tool it's perfect for checking out ideas, inspecting the value of variables and confirming syntax.
It's also extremely useful for debugging, as we can log values to the console in our code.

Create a file called *scripts.js* in the *basic_template* folder, next to *index.html*.
Add the following content to the file.

```js
const arr = ['document.createElement', 'element.textContent', 'parent.append'];
const ol = document.createElement('ol');
for (const item of arr) {
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.textContent = item;
    ol.append(li);
}
document.body.append(ol);
```

> Study the code and try to predict what it will do.

The script will not execute on it's own.
We need to include it in the document.

Update the `<body>` as follows:

```html
<body>
    <h1>A simple pattern</h1>
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
```

Now refresh the page (*ctrl + R*) and see what happened.

First, we declared an array of simple strings.
This is the content for the list items we will insert into our ordered list.

```js
const arr = ['document.createElement', 'element.textContent', 'parent.append'];
```

Then we created the ordered list (`<ol>`) element.

```js
const ol = document.createElement('ol');
```

Then we loop over the array using a for..of loop.

```js
for (const item of arr) {
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.textContent = item;
    ol.append(li);
}
```

In each iteration, we create a list item (`<li>`) element, set it's content to the current value from the array and insert it into the `<ol>` element.

Finally, we append the `<ol>` element (including it's three children) to the document `<body>`. 

```js
document.body.append(ol);
```

### Passing data to the console

If we want to debug your code, it's often useful to pass data to the [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console).
Try something like this.

```js
const arr = ['document.createElement', 'element.textContent', 'parent.append'];
console.table(arr);
const ol = document.createElement('ol');
for (const item of arr) {
    console.log(item);
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.textContent = item;
    ol.append(li);
}
document.body.append(ol);
```

The JavaScript [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) is extremely powerful and has many useful features. 
For simple usage, [console.table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/table) is really useful for arrays and objects.
Otherwise, [console.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log) is basically like `print` in python.

![logging to the JS console]({{"assets/img/week_5/console-log.png" | relative_url}})

Notice how the log message includes a reference back to the file, including the line number.
So you can see exactly which line logged each value.

## String template literals

JavaScript has template literals very similar to python f-strings.
Rather than being identified with an `f`, they are identified by using backticks (\`like this\`) instead of single or double quotes.

Inside the template literal, JavaScript expressions can be inserted using a dollar sign and curly braces `${}`.

```js
const language = "JavaScript";
const message = `hello ${language}.`;
```

> The [backtick key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick#:~:text=The%20sign%20is%20located%20on,right%20side%20of%20the%20layout.) is usually on the top-left of a UK or US keyboard to the left of the *1* key.

## Conditional statements

[Conditional statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) are very similar to python, just using the JavaScript syntax of curly braces and parentheses.

```js
const a = "something truthy";
if(a) {
    console.log(`a is ${a}`);
}
```

## Loops

Loops can be achieved in a number of ways.

### for loops

The [old-style for loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) is verbose but allows for a lot of flexibility.
The basic syntax is as follows:

```
for (initialization; condition; afterthought) {
  statements
}
```

A concrete example is something like this:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
This is often known as a [traditional C-Style for loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop#Traditional_for-loops).
The *initialisation* step is evaluated once before the loop begins. 
In this case it declares a variable `i` and assigns it the value `0`.
The *condition* provides a conditional statement that is evaluated before each iteration.
If it is true then the loop statement will execute, if not the end of the loop has been reached.
In this case, the loop will end when `i` is greater than or equal to `10`.
The *afterthought* is a statement that is executed at the end of each loop.
It is generally used to modify the state if variables declared in the initialisation step. 
In this case it increments the variable `i`.

### for...of loops

The for...of loop is similar to the python `for` loop.
It iterates over an iterable such as an [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or a [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).

Here we loop over each character in a string and log it to the console.

```js
const data = "hello world";
for(const item of data) {
    console.log(item);
}
```

> Just like the python for...in clause.
> We need to declare a variable (`item` in this case) to hold the iterated values.

### Array.forEach

Another way to loop over iterables such as arrays is to call the built-in `Array.forEach` method with a *callback* function.
We will cover functions and callbacks in [the next exercise]({{"exercises/5.2.html" | relative_url}}).
