title: Using classes and modules
description: In this exercise we will develop a complex scene with different elements. Each object will be responsible for updating and drawing itself.
---

{% assign challenges = site.challenges | where:"lab", 6.2 | sort: "id" %}

In the last exercise we developed a pattern which allowed us to create fairly complex scene data.
We created a list of objects with various properties that related to how they were rendered on the canvas (e.g. location, size, angle) and how they behaved (e.g. movement, rotation frequency).

Following on from the last exercise, in this exercise, we will introduce an object-oriented approach which will add methods to our objects so they can provide complex capabilities such as updating and drawing themselves.

This approach has two main advantages.
Firstly, it allows us to clear out clutter from our central logic and thus makes it easier to add further layers of complexity. 
Secondly, it allows us to create different types of objects in which we keep all the related data and logic together in one place.

Since our objects know how to behave and how they look, we can focus on how they interact.

> Copy the template from the previous exercise and name it *Example 4: Using classes* or similar.

## Using ES6 modules

Since 2015, JavaScript has supported modules.
Now browser support is good, we should always consider using modules for moderately complex projects.

Update the `<script>` element in your *index.html* as follows.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example 4: Using classes</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="scripts.js" type="module" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Example 4: Using classes</h1>
    <canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="600"></canvas>    
</body>
</html>
```

Notice we have added a `type="module"` attribute to our script element.
This means we can use multiple files and the `import` and `export` keywords.
We have also moved the script into the `<head>` element and added the `defer` attribute to indicate that the module should not be executed until the DOM is loaded.

> Make sure you are using the [live server]({{"references/live-server" | relative_url}}) extension.
> Without this, modules won't work.

## Define a class

We are going to need to build some infrastructure before anything will work.

Let's start with a class `Thing`.
It will be a pointy shape drawn on the canvas, a thing with some encoded behaviour. 

Put the following code in a new file called `thing.js`.

```js
export default class Thing {
    constructor(x, y, size, hue) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.fillStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 30%, 60%)`;
    }

    update(elapsed) {
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.save();
        ctx.fillStyle = this.fillStyle;
        ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(0, 0, this.size/2, Math.PI / 2, 1.5 * Math.PI)
        ctx.lineTo(this.size, 0);
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.restore();
    }
}
```

We have defined a `Thing` class.
Notice the keywords `export default`.
Modules can choose to selectively make their classes, functions and variables available for import in other modules.
In this case we are exporting our `Thing` class.
This means other modules can easily import this class from the *thing.js* module.

Our class has a `Thing.constructor` method that requires coordinates `x` and `y`, a `size` and a `hue`.
The `x` and `y` coordinates are allocated to `this.x` and `this.y`.
Similarly, the `size` argument is allocated to `this.size`.
The `hue` argument is used to set the `this.fillStyle` property to an [hsl colour](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl).
From all this, we can imaging that our instances will have unique locations on the canvas, and they will each be a different size and colour. 

There is an `Thing.update()` method which does nothing.
There is an `Thing.draw()` method which takes a single `ctx` argument and draws a half-circle with a point facing to the right (which is zero radians, importantly).

So we can see, instances of our `Thing` class will know their position and will know how to draw themselves.
Later, we will add logic so they also know how to behave. 

But this code alone won't do anything.
For a start, we haven't even loaded this script.
Our things will need to be instantiated by some higher-level code.

## An object to manage everything in the scene

The next step is to create another object which represents our entire scene.
This object will manage `Thing` instances as data.

Put this code in a new file *scene.js*.

```js
import Thing from './thing.js';

export default class Scene {
    constructor(nThings, canvas) {
        this.things = Array.from({length: nThings}, () => {
            return new Thing(
                Math.random() * canvas.width,  // x
                Math.random() * canvas.height, // y
                20 + Math.random() * 10,       // size
                Math.random() * 360            // hue
            );
        });
    }
    
    update(elapsed) {
        this.things.forEach(thing => {
            thing.update(elapsed);
        });
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);
        this.things.forEach(thing => {
            thing.draw(ctx);
        });
    }
}
```

The first line imports our `Thing` class from *thing.js*.

The code then declares a `Scene` class.
It has a `Scene.constructor` method which takes two arguments. The `nThings` argument specifies the number of things we want in our scene.
The `canvas` argument is a canvas element which will give us our maximum coordinates. 

The `Scene.constructor` method does one thing.
It creates an array of `Thing` instances with random coordinates, random sizes and random hues.
When a scene is created, the number of `Thing` instances can be set with the `nThings` argument.

The `Scene.update` method simply loops over the array of things and calls each of their `update` methods in turn.
It passes the provided `elapsed` argument as a parameter.

The `Scene.draw` method is similar, it first clears the canvas, then it loops over the array of things and calls each of their `draw` methods in turn.
Again, passing the `ctx` argument as a parameter.

Still, this code isn't even imported yet. 

## Running the *game loop*

We still haven't loaded any of this code, we need to put some code into *scripts.js* to *bootstrap* the system.

Here's all we need.
Add this to *scripts.js*.

```js
import Scene from './scene.js';

const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
const scene = new Scene(100, canvas);

let p;
function frame(ts) {
    const elapsed = ts - p || 0;
    scene.update(elapsed / 1000);
    scene.draw(ctx);
    p = ts;
    requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
requestAnimationFrame(frame);
```

Study this.
It should be familiar, with a few minor changes.

We now import the `Scene` class and create an instance, `scene`.
We then have a stripped down `frame()` function that simply calculates the elapsed time and delegates all the other work to the `scene` object.

This should be enough to produce a working system.
You should see something like this.

<figure>
    <img 
        src="{{"assets/img/week_6/scene1.png" | relative_url}}" 
        alt="one hundred colourful teardrops pointing to the right"
        style="background: #eee; border: 1px solid #333;"
    >
</figure>

We now have a system that will create a `Scene` class and animate the scene using `requestAnimationFrame`.
The `Scene` instance initialises and animates all the objects in the scene, maintaining a clear separation of update operations and drawing operations.
For now the `Scene` class only creates instances of the `Thing` class.
Later, we can add more object types easily.

## Adding more properties

Our `Thing` class is being animated, but the `Thing.update` method doesn't do anything.

Before we add behaviour, we'll add an `angle` property, so each `Thing` points in a random direction.
Here's the updated `Thing.constructor` method.

```js
    constructor(x, y, size, hue, angle) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.fillStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 30%, 60%)`;
        this.angle = angle;
    }
```

And we can pass in a randomised angle for now in the `Scene.constructor` method.

```js
    constructor(nThings, canvas) {
        this.things = Array.from({length: nThings}, () => {
            return new Thing(

                Math.random() * canvas.width,  // x
                Math.random() * canvas.height, // y
                20 + Math.random() * 10,       // size
                Math.random() * 360,           // hue
                Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI    // angle
            );
        });
    }
```

> Keeping the randomisation separate means we can change the `Scene` to create something more intentional if we want.
> We shall see this later.

Now we have an angle, we can update the `Thing.draw` method to rotate the canvas accordingly.

```js
    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.save();
        ctx.fillStyle = this.fillStyle;
        ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
        ctx.rotate(this.angle);
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(0, 0, this.size/2, Math.PI / 2, 1.5 * Math.PI)
        ctx.lineTo(this.size, 0);
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.restore();
    }
```

Now we can see the things are all pointing in different directions.

<figure>
    <img 
        src="{{"assets/img/week_6/scene2.png" | relative_url}}" 
        alt="one hundred colourful teardrops pointing in random directions"
        style="background: #eee; border: 1px solid #333;"
    >
</figure>

## Thing behaviour

So, we have these things, but they don't do anything.
This is because their `update()` method is empty.

Here's some code that makes them rotate somewhat randomly (in a *clamped random walk*).

First, we initialise a `rotationRate` property in the `Thing.constructor`.

```js
    constructor(x, y, size, hue, angle) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.fillStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 30%, 60%)`;
        this.angle = angle;
        this.rotationRate = 0;
    }
```

We initialised it to zero, but then each frame, it is randomised in the new `Thing.update` method.
Then we use it to update the `angle` property (which will affect the rotation of our object).

```js
    update(elapsed) {
        this.rotationRate += (Math.random() - 0.5);
        this.rotationRate = Math.max(this.rotationRate, -2 * Math.PI);
        this.rotationRate = Math.min(this.rotationRate, 2 * Math.PI);
        this.angle += this.rotationRate * elapsed;
    }
```


First, we tweak the existing `rotationRate` (a bit like randomly moving the steering wheel).

> `(Math.random - 0.5)` is a common way to get a random value between `-0.5` and `+0.5`.
> Adding this to the `rotationRate` each frame creates a *random walk*.

Then we *clamp* the `rotationRate` so it doesn't go outside a predefined range.
This is much better than just randomising the `angle` property directly.

We clamp the `rotationRate` to one *rotation per second* in either direction.
So it doesn't get out of control.

> feel free to let the `rotationRate` get larger, the things will spin faster. 
> Or restrict it even more, so the things don't turn much.

You should see the things rotating in a satisfyingly random way.

### Moving

Now we are going to have the things move forwards.
So we need to add a `speed` property to our `Thing.constructor`.

```js
    constructor(x, y, size, hue, angle) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.fillStyle = `hsl(${hue}, 30%, 60%)`;
        this.angle = angle;
        this.rotationRate = 0;
        this.speed = 100;
    }
```

Moving them in the direction they are pointing requires some simple trigonometry.
We will define what are known as *getter* methods for `Thing.xSpeed` and `Thing.ySpeed` using the `get` keyword.
These are calculated values based on `Thing.speed` and `Thing.angle`, so we can define these *getter* methods to make our `Thing.update` code simpler.

```js
    get xSpeed() {
        return Math.cos(this.angle) * this.speed;
    }
    get ySpeed() {
        return Math.sin(this.angle) * this.speed;
    }
```

> getter methods are very much like the `@property` decorator in python.
> They allow a method to be accessed like a dynamic property (without calling).

Now, we can add these values on to our `x` and `y` coordinates within our `Thing.update` method.

```js
    update(elapsed) {
        this.rotationRate += (Math.random() - 0.5);
        this.rotationRate = Math.max(this.rotationRate, -2 * Math.PI);
        this.rotationRate = Math.min(this.rotationRate, 2 * Math.PI);
        this.angle += this.rotationRate * elapsed;
        this.x += this.xSpeed * elapsed;
        this.y += this.ySpeed * elapsed;
    }
```

Check out the canvas now.
You should see the things moving around with smooth steering because we used the *clamped random walk*.

Finally, if you wait long enough, the things start disappearing off the side of the canvas.
Fixing this is left as an exercise for you.

<figure>
<canvas id="scene3" width="300px" height="300px" style="background: #eee; border: 2px solid #333; width: 600px;"></canvas>
</figure>

## Defining a different object

Let's define another class for a different object type.
Create a file *follower.js* and add the following code.

```js
export default class Follower {
    constructor(x, y, speed, target) {
        this.target = target;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    get angle() {
        const dy = this.target.y - this.y;
        const dx = this.target.x - this.x;
        return Math.atan2(dy, dx);
    }

    get xSpeed() {
        return Math.cos(this.angle) * this.speed;
    }
    get ySpeed() {
        return Math.sin(this.angle) * this.speed;
    }

    update(elapsed) {
        this.x += this.xSpeed * elapsed;
        this.y += this.ySpeed * elapsed;
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.save();
        ctx.strokeStyle = this.target.fillStyle;
        ctx.lineWidth = 2;
        ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
        ctx.rotate(this.angle);
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(-10, 0);
        ctx.lineTo(10, 0);
        ctx.moveTo(5, -5);
        ctx.lineTo(10, 0);
        ctx.lineTo(5, 5);
        ctx.stroke();
        ctx.restore();
    }
}
```

Study this object carefully.
One thing you should notice about the constructor is that is takes a `target` as an argument and stores it as a property.
This is because the behaviour of this object is to follow its `this.target`, which must be an object with `x` and `y` properties.

The `angle` is where this core logic is implemented.
We use [Math.atan2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/atan2) to calculate the angle between our own location and the `target` we are following.
This means we always point directly towards our target.

The `this.angle` property feeds into the `xSpeed` and `ySpeed` properties which are calculated based on `this.angle` and `this.speed`.
If we follow the logic from the `update()` method, we can see tha this means we always move in the direction we are pointing.

The `draw()` method simply draws an arrow.
We also take on the `target.fillStyle` as our `strokeStyle`, which indicates that our `target` value should probably be a `Thing` instance.

## Integrating it into our scene

Integrating our new object type into our `Scene` is pretty easy.
We will create a new Array of `Follower` instances, one for each `Thing`.
Then we simply update and draw each one.

```js
import Thing from './thing.js';
import Follower from './follower.js';

export default class Scene {
    constructor(nThings, canvas) {
        this.things = Array.from({length: nThings}, () => {
            return new Thing(
                Math.random() * canvas.width, 
                Math.random() * canvas.height,
                20 + Math.random() * 10, 
                Math.random() * 360,
                Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI
            );
        });
        this.followers = this.things.map((thing) => {
            return new Follower(
                canvas.width / 2, 
                canvas.height / 2, 
                thing.speed / 2, thing
            );
        });
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);
        this.followers.forEach(thing => {
            thing.draw(ctx);
        });
        this.things.forEach(thing => {
            thing.draw(ctx);
        });
    }
    
    update(elapsed) {
        this.things.forEach(thing => {
            thing.update(elapsed);
        });
        this.followers.forEach(thing => {
            thing.update(elapsed);
        });
    }
}
```

Notice that we used the `Array.map` method to create an array of `Follower` objects containing exactly one for each `Thing`.
We also ensure that the `Follower` is much slower then the `Thing` by setting its speed to `thing.speed / 2`.

> The `Follower` objects are much more manoeuvrable and so they can catch up when their `target` is turning.
