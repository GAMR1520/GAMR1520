## Python origins

Python was initially designed by *Guido van Rossum* with emphasis on code readability, its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

>**Readability counts**
>"A programming language is more than how you tell a computer what to do. It is how programmers express and communicate ideas. The audience for your code is other programmers, not computers."
*Guido van Rossum*

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Development

The first official release was in 1991.
By 2001, ten years later, [the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) was launched.

Python has evolved over decades and been through some major changes in that time.
In particular, the traumatic transition to *python3*.

## Python as a dynamically typed language

>**TLDR;**
>In dynamically typed languages **type information is associated with the data**, not the variable.

Python has dynamically-typed variables.
In practice, this means that variables can be changed fom one type to another.

```python
a = 1
a = 'two'
```

The remainder of this lecture provides a sketch of what is happening in this simple programme.


>There is a *lot* going on under the hood with python, even with this simple programme.
>By relinquishing some control to python, your code can be simple and expressive.

## A simple model of computation

A basic model of a computer has memory which holds data and a CPU which manages instructions and performs calculations.

<figure>
    <img src="{{"assets/img/Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg" | relative_url}}">
    <figcaption>
        Von Neumann architecture (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25789639">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Modern computers are said to be **computationally universal** because they can be programmed to do any computation.

---

## Instruction set

Every processor has an **instruction set** which defines the primitive operations that it can perform.
These are the building blocks from which all computer programmes are constructed.

- data handling and memory
- arithmetic and logic operations
- control flow


<figure>
    <img src="{{"assets/img/language-layers.svg" | relative_url}}">
    <figcaption>
        Higher level languages have more abstraction
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Such instructions are provided to the processor in **machine code**, the lowest-level of computer 'language', in which each instruction is represented by a unique combination of bits.

---


## Compilation

Some computer languages (such as C and Rust) are **compiled** into a format suitable for the CPU to consume directly.

<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
        subgraph compiled ["e.g. C, Rust"]
            source["Source code"]-->compiler[Compiler]
            compiler[Compiler]-->assembler["Assembler"]
        end
        assembler-->machinecode["Machine code"]
        input[Input]-->machinecode
        machinecode-->output[Output]
    </div>
</figure>

This compilation step can produce very efficient code through careful analysis and optimisation. 
However, it needs to be performed specifically for a given hardware architecture and typically requires the programmer to manage all the details of memory management.

>Compilers are *bootstrapped* in another language and then *self-compiled*.
>Assembly languages are said to be *assembled* rather than compiled.
Each assembly language is typically restricted to one processor architecture.

---

## Interpretation

Other languages (such as python and javascript) are compiled to an intermediate form that is **interpreted** by a special programme that actually interacts with the processor.


<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
        subgraph interpreted ["e.g. Python, Javascript"]
            source["Source code"]-->compiler["Compiler"]
            compiler-->bytecode["Byte code"]
            bytecode-->virtualmachine["Virtual machine"];
        end
        input[Input]-->virtualmachine
        virtualmachine-->output[Output]
    </div>
</figure>

Interpreted languages define their own `byte code` specifications which can be used on any machine.
This makes them portable and very convenient.

>The canonical Python compiler/interpreter implementation is **CPython** (written in *C*).
>Though there are many different implementations (e.g. *IronPython*, *Jython*, *PyPy*)

## Memory and data types

Binary data in memory can store integers.

<figure>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR;
subgraph memory
0b00000001
0b00000010
0b00000011
end
</div>
</figure>


Complex data can be represented in binary format through standards such as ASCII and unicode for characters and IEEE754 for floating point numbers (i.e. non-integers).

<figure>
<div class="auto-grid">
    <span>a = 97</span>
    <span>b = 98</span>
    <span>c = 99</span>
    <span>d = 100</span>
    <span>e = 101</span>
    <span>f = 102</span>
    <span>g = 103</span>
    <span>h = 104</span>
    <span>i = 105</span>
    <span>j = 106</span>
    <span>k = 107</span>
    <span>l = 108</span>
    <span>m = 109</span>
    <span>n = 110</span>
    <span>o = 111</span>
    <span>p = 112</span>
    <span>q = 113</span>
    <span>r = 114</span>
    <span>s = 115</span>
    <span>t = 116</span>
    <span>u = 117</span>
    <span>v = 118</span>
    <span>w = 119</span>
    <span>x = 120</span>
    <span>y = 121</span>
    <span>z = 122</span>
</div>
</figure>

>This is what we mean by the **type** of data.
>All data in computers is ultimately stored as zeroes and ones but what those zeroes and ones **means** depends on what you are doing.


---

## Pointers

An important type of data is **pointer** which holds the value of a unique memory address. 
Pointers identify the location of some other data in memory.
Every location in memory has a unique address.

<figure>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR;
subgraph somewhere in memory
0b00000001
0b00000010
end

0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> 0b00000001
0x7f3b40df0110 ---> 0b00000010
</div>
</figure>


32-bits of data are enough to uniquely identify a single byte within <em>2<sup>32</sup></em> bytes (4,294,967,296 bytes or *4 GB*) of memory.

>64-bits of data are in principle enough to uniquely identify a single byte within <em>2<sup>64</sup></em> bytes (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes or *16 Billion GB*) of memory.
Though a real system doesn't quite use 64 bits for directly addressing memory.

## Statically typed variables

In languages with statically typed variables, each variable must be declared with a type that cannot change.
This code in C demonstrates the idea.
We are declaring a variable `a` of type `int` and assigning it to the value 1.
Then the code updates the value of `a`, setting it to 2.

```C
int a = 1;
a = 2;
```

>Both operations will write data into the same chunk of memory.

Since C is a statically typed language, the type of a variable cannot be changed. 

```C
int b = 1;
b = "two";
```

>This code will not compile.

---


## Dynamically typed languages

In dynamically typed languages, types are associated with values, not variables.
All data in python are represented internally as `pyObjects`.
The following code creates a pyObject of type `<int>` with the value `1`.

```python
a = 1
```

In python, variables are simply names, pointing to these complex objects.

<figure>
    <table>
        <tr><th colspan="2">pyObject</th></tr><tr><th>id</th><td>0x7fa8655e00f0</td></tr>
        <tr><th>type</th><td>&lt;class &#x27;int&#x27;&gt;</td></tr>
        <tr><th>value</th><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th>refs</th><td>1</td></tr>
    </table>
    <figcaption>A pyObject</figcaption>
</figure>


>The size of the integer `1` in memory is *28 bytes*.
The size of the type `<class 'int'>` is *408 bytes*.
Both are pyObjects.

---

## Inspecting a pyObject's identifier

We can view the identifier of an object in python using `built-in` function `id()`.

```python
id(a)
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
140361231892720
```
{: .small-margin}

The identifier is an integer.

>In the CPython implementation, the id is a memory location.
>We can express it as a hexadecimal using an [f-string]({{"references/f-strings" | relative_url}}).
>```python
>f'{id(a):#x}'
>```
>{: .small-margin}
>```plaintext
>0x7fa8655e00f0
>```
>{: .small-margin}

---

## Inspecting object type

The `built-in` function `type` will allow us to inspect the type of `a`.

```python
type(a)
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
<class 'int'>
```
{: .small-margin}

The type in this case, is the class `int`.
Integers are instances of the class `int`

>Types also have a type!
>```python
>type(type(a))
>```
>{: .small-margin}
>```plaintext
><class 'type'>
>```
>{: .small-margin}
> Types are instances of the class `type`!

---

## Inspecting attributes

Depending on their type, objects sometimes have methods which we can use.
To get a list of all attributes, we can use the built-in `dir()` function.
The result can be confusing.
String objects have lots of methods.
Many of which are so-called `__dunder__` methods.

```python
dir('hello')
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'removeprefix', 'removesuffix', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## Ignore the `__dunder__` methods

In python, methods (and other attributes) with *double underscores* are special.
For now, we can ignore them with a [*list comprehension*]({{"references/list-comprehensions" | relative_url }}) that filters the list to only those without the double underscores. 

```python
[method for method in dir('hello') if not method.startswith('__')]
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
['capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'removeprefix', 'removesuffix', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
```
{: .small-margin}

Notice that the `dir` method returned a `list` of `string` attribute names.
Also notice that we used the `startswith` method in the above list comprehension.
