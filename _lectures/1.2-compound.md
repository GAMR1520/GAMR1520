title: Compound statements and data
description: In python, compound statements allow programmers to specify blocks of code which should be executed under certain conditions or in certain contexts. Compound data types enable programmers to create complex, mutable data structures.

## Basic types

In python, there are many built-in types.

The most common basic types are `int`, `float`, `bool` and `str`.

- 
```python
# immutable
a = int('45.9')
b = 15 // 4
c = 4387372
```
- 
```python
# immutable
a = float(2)
b = 32 / 2
c = 2.8
```
- 
```python
# immutable
a = bool('')
b = a < 1
c = False
```
- 
```python
# immutable
a = str(True)
b = 'hello'
c = 'hello'.upper()
```

> Strings are a bit different because they are *sequences* of characters and so they are more interesting.

---

## String manipulation

Strings, are **immutable** *sequences* of characters, a form of compound data type.
These methods never change the value of a string, they return new string instances.

- 
```python
'hello world'.upper()
```
- 
```python
'HELLO WORLD'
```
- 
```python
'hello world'.capitalize()
```
- 
```python
'Hello world'
```
- 
```python
'hello world'.title()
```
- 
```python
'Hello World'
```
- 
```python
'hello world'.split()
```
- 
```python
['hello', 'world']
```
- 
```python
'hello world'.split('o')
```
- 
```python
['hell', 'w', 'rld']
```
- 
```python
'hello'.join('world')
```
- 
```python
'whelloohellorhellolhellod'
```

## Immutability

The `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str` and `tuple` data types are immutable.
This means that instances of these types cannot be modified.

```python
a = 100000000
a += 1
```

<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph variables
        a
    end
    subgraph objects ["these are pyObjects, not bytes"]
        100000000
        100000001
    end
    subgraph gc ["this memory is freed"]
        available
    end
    a-- 0x7f3b40df00f0 --->100000001
    100000000-- "Garbage collector" --->gc
    </div>
</figure>

>Though it may sometimes seem like they are being modified, in fact, new *pyObjects* are created in memory.

## Compound types

Compound types provide us with structures to group data together.
They tend to be mutable, except for strings and tuples.

- 
```python
# immutable
a = tuple('hello')
b = (1.0, 'hello')
c = ('hello', )
d = a[:3]
```
- 
```python
# mutable
a = list('hello')
b = [1.0, 'hello']
c = a + b
d = 'hello world'.split()
```
- 
```python
    # mutable
    a = dict((('a', 2), ('b', 4)))
    b = {
        'a': 1.0, 
        'b': 'hello'
    }
```
- 
```python
# mutable
a = set('hello')
b = {1.0, 'hello', 'e', 'o'}
c = a | b
d = a & b
e = a - b
```

## Combining compound types

Compound types can easily be combined to produce the data structures you need.

```python
player_data = {
    "health": 82,
    "attack": 21,
    "shield": 5,
    "magic": 76,
    "speed": 45,
    "inventory": [
        { "name": "blue potion", "type": "health", "power": 6 }
    ],
    "check-point": 84
}

sword = { "name": "massive sword", "type": "weapon", "power": 9 }
player_data['inventory'].append(sword)
```

## More built-in types

Many more exotic types exist but we don't really need to know about them all.
We have seen examples of some of these.
You will often find yourself using them without realising it.

- 
```python
type(None).__name__
```
- 
```plaintext
'NoneType'
```
- 
```python
type(print).__name__
```
- 
```plaintext
'builtin_function_or_method'
```
- 
```python
type(''.center).__name__
```
- 
```plaintext
'builtin_function_or_method'
```
- 
```python
type(reversed('hello')).__name__
```
- 
```plaintext
'reversed'
```
- 
```python
type(type(1)).__name__
```
- 
```plaintext
'type'
```

> The key point is that everything is an object, everything has a type.

## Sequences

Sequences (such as `str`, `tuple` and `list`) store items in a particular order and allow for *indexing* and *slicing*.

- ### Indexing
- 
- 
```python
('I', 'just', 'wanna', 'tell', 'you', 'how', "I'm", 'feeling')[2]
```
- 
```plaintext
'wanna'
```
- 
```python
'Gotta make you understand'[-1]
```
- 
```plaintext
'd'
```
- ### Slicing
- 
- 
```python
['I', 'just', 'wanna', 'tell', 'you', 'how', "I'm", 'feeling'][1::2]
```
- 
```plaintext
['just', 'tell', 'how', 'feeling']
```
- 
```python
'Gotta make you understand'[::4]
```

# Compound statements

Compound statements control the flow and context of code execution within *code blocks* defined using indentation.

- 
```python
    while input('Yes? [y/n]: ') == 'y':
        print("yes!")
```
- 
```python
    with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
```
{: .grid-code-2}

- 
```python
    if a:
        print(a)
```
- 
```python
    for ch in 'hello':
        print(ch)
```
- 
```python
    def play_game():
        print('fun!')
```
{: .grid-code-3}

- 
```python
    try:
        guess = int(input('guess: '))
    except ValueError:
        print("That's not a number!")
```
- 
```python
    class Guess:
        def __init__(self, actual):
            self.value = input('guess: ')
            self.correct = self.value == actual
```

## Looping over sequences with `for`

A `for` loop will run the code block once for each iterated value.
The `for` syntax requires a named variable, followed by the keyword `in`, followed by an *iterable* object.

*Sequences* are *iterable*, so they can be used in a `for` loop.

```python
things_ill_never_do = ["give you up", "let you down", "run around and desert you"]

for this_thing in things_ill_never_do:
    print(f"Never gonna {this_thing}")
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## `if` and `while`

The `if` and `while` clauses require a conditional statement which is *evaluated for truth*.
If the statement evaluates to `True` then the block is executed, otherwise the block is skipped.

- 
```python
    if True:
        print('this always happens')
    else:
        print('this never happens')
    print('followed by this')
```
- 
```python
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        print(f'continuously happens ({count})')
    print('this never happens')
```
{: .grid-code-2}

The `while` loop will repeat until the conditional evaluates to `False`.
The above example using `while True:` is an *infinite loop* which can only be exited using the `break` keyword.
The `continue` keyword can be used to skip to the next loop.
Both `break` and `continue` can be used in `for` loops too.

- 
```python
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        if count > 10:
            break;
```
- 
```python
    for i in range(200):
        print('every time')
        if i < 100:
            continue
        print("from 100 only")
```

## Iterables

An *iterable* is an object capable of returning its members one at a time.
If it makes sense to iterate over something, then it's probably an iterable.

> All sequences are iterable, plus the `dict` type and *file-like* objects.

```python
for key in player_data:
    print(f'{key}: {player_data[key]}')
```

But also methods will return iterables, such as `dict.items()` which iterates over the `(key, value)` pairs.
This is often more convenient than looping over the keys alone. 

```python
for key, value in player_data.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value}')
```
