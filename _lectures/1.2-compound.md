title: Compound statements and data
description: In python, compound statements allow programmers to specify blocks of code which should be executed under certain conditions or in certain contexts. Compound data types enable programmers to create complex, mutable data structures.

## Built-in types

In python, there are many built-in types.

There are a handful of built-in data types which we are most concerned with:

<div class="auto-grid">
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>int()</code>
            <small><em>Immutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>2</code>,
            <code>3</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>float()</code>
            <small><em>Immutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>100.1</code>,
            <code>0.001</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>bool()</code>
            <small><em>Immutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>True</code>,
            <code>False</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>str()</code>
            <small><em>Immutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>'a'</code>,
            <code>'hello'</code>
        </p>
    </section>
</div>

Compound types allow us to group data together.

<div class="auto-grid">
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>tuple()</code>
            <small><em>Immutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>(1, 2, 'hello world')</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>list()</code>
            <small><em>Mutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>[1, 2, 'hello']</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>set()</code>
            <small><em>Mutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>{1, 2, 'hello'}</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            <code>dict()</code>
            <small><em>Mutable</em></small>
        </header>
        <p>
            <code>{1: 2, 'hello': 'world'}</code>
        </p>
    </section>
</div>

Compound data types tend to be mutable, except for strings and tuples.

>Strings, as sequences of characters, are really compound data types.
Python provides a powerful set of tools for working with strings.

## More built-in types

It's worth noting that there are other built-in types.
We have also seen examples of these:

```python
type(None) 
type(print)
type(''.center)
type(type(1))
>>> 

```

```plaintext
<class 'NoneType'>
<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
<class 'type'>
```

Many more exotic types exist but we don't really need to know about them all.
The key point is that everything is an object, everything has a type.

## Immutability

The `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str` and `tuple` data types are immutable.
This means that instances of these types cannot be modified.

```python
a = 100000000
a += 1
```

<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph variables
        a
    end
    subgraph pyObjects
        100000000
        100000001
    end

    a -- 0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> 100000001
    </div>
</figure>

>Though it may sometimes seem like they are being modified, in fact, new *pyObjects* are created in memory.

## Mutable types

The most common mutable data types are the `list`, `dict` and `set` types.
These are more flexible than a `tuple` and can easily be combined to produce the data structures you need.

```python
saved_game = {
    "health": 82,
    "attack": 21,
    "shield": 5,
    "magic": 76,
    "speed": 45,
    "inventory": [
        { "name": "blue potion", "type": "health", "power": 6 }
    ],
    "check-point": 84
}

sword = { "name": "massive sword", "type": "weapon", "power": 9 }
saved_game['inventory'].append(sword)
```

## Compound data types - sequences

Compound data types provide a means to build collections of values.
Indexed sequences (such as `str`, `tuple` and `list`) store items in a particular order and allow for *indexing* and *slicing*.

### Indexing

```python
('I', 'just', 'wanna', 'tell', 'you', 'how', "I'm", 'feeling')[2]
'Gotta make you understand'[-1]
```
{: .small-code}
```plaintext
'wanna'
'd'
```
{: .small-code}

### Slicing

```python
['I', 'just', 'wanna', 'tell', 'you', 'how', "I'm", 'feeling'][1::2]
'Gotta make you understand'[::4]
```
{: .small-code}
```plaintext
['just', 'tell', 'how', 'feeling']
'Gakonsd'
```
{: .small-code}

## Compound statements

In python, compound statements allow for the definition of *code blocks*.
Blocks of code are defined using indentation.

```python
things_ill_never_do = ["give you up", "let you down", "run around and desert you"]

for this_thing in things_ill_never_do:
    print(f"Never gonna {this_thing}")
```

```plaintext
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
```

Different compound statements can be used to control the flow and context of code execution using *keywords* such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `with`, `class`, `try` and `except`.

> We will look at all of these over the coming weeks.
