## Reminder

Even the simplest value in python is a complex object.
If we create an integer, we are instantiating an object of type `int`.
This gives us access to a lot of *magic*.

```python
a = 1
```

<figure>
    <table>
        <tr><th colspan="2">pyObject</th></tr><tr><th>id</th><td>0x7fa8655e00f0</td></tr>
        <tr><th>type</th><td>&lt;class &#x27;int&#x27;&gt;</td></tr>
        <tr><th>value</th><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr class="highlight"><th>refs</th><td>1</td></tr>
    </table>
    <figcaption>A pyObject</figcaption>
</figure>

The memory allocated to our objects is managed for us by the python interpreter.
Objects will be cleared from memory once they are no longer accessible to our programme.
This is achieved by *counting references*.

---

## Reference counting

```python
a = "hello"
```
<figure class="grid2by2">
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph python variables
        a
    end
    subgraph One reference to pyObject
        hello["hello (1)"]
    end
    a -- 0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> hello
    </div>
</figure>
```python
b = a
```
<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph python variables
        a
        b
    end
    subgraph Two references to pyObject
        hello["hello (2)"]
    end

    a -- 0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> hello
    b -- 0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> hello
    </div>
</figure>

---

## Reference counting

```python
a = "hello"
b = a
a = "world"
```

<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph python variables
        a
        b
    end
    subgraph One reference each
        world["world (1)"]
        hello["hello (1)"]
    end
    a -- 0x7f3b40d83f70 ---> world
    b -- 0x7f3b40df00f0 ---> hello
    </div>
</figure>

A new pyObject is created at location `0x7f3b40d83f70` containing the string `'world'`.
The variable `a` points to the new object.
The variable `b` still points to the original object.

---

## Reference counting

```python
a = "hello"
b = a
a = "world"
b = "world"
```
<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR;
    subgraph python variables
        a
        b
    end
    subgraph 'hello' has no more references
        world["world (2)"]
        hello["hello (0)"]
    end
    a -- 0x7f3b40d83f70 ---> world
    b -- 0x7f3b40d83f70 ---> world
    </div>
</figure>

The pyObject at `0x7f3b40df00f0`, containing the string `'hello'` no longer has any references.
It will be identified by the garbage collector and the memory will be freed for use.

---


## Reference counting *implementation detail*

Simple objects like Boolean values and smaller integers are automatically reused and are not garbage collected.

```python
id(100)
id(100)
```
These would be expected to generate different identifiers.
Each statement should create a value in memory, return it's location, and immediately set the reference count to zero.

```plaintext
140397168938320
140397168938320
```

We get *the same identifier*, indicating that the same location in memory was used for both objects, even though no variable was created referencing the object.
>This is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon in code.

---

## Reference counting *implementation detail*

If we create larger objects, the behaviour is as expected.
They will be created on demand and destroyed quickly.

```python
id(1000000000)
id(1000000000)
```

Each statement creates a separate object in memory, which is discarded immediately.

```plaintext
140397166989520
140397166989936
```
>The numbers are different, this is what you should be assuming.
Data in memory are erased very quickly once no longer referenced. 


---

## Machine code and byte code

Code is a form of data too.
Once compiled, instructions can be reduced to machine code.
The CPU manages the flow through the sequence of instructions by incrementing a counter.
Some instructions can be used to change the counter value.


> In interpreted languages like python, the interpreter consumes byte code.
Every python programme is compiled to bytecode, we will look at a few examples to get a sense of what is going on.

```python
def conditional_return(a):
    if a:
        return "some value"

```
{: .small-code}
```plaintext
 	OPCODE	OPNAME        		ARG	ARGVAL
0	124	LOAD_FAST           	0	a
2	114	POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE   	4	8
4	100	LOAD_CONST          	1	some value
6	83	RETURN_VALUE        	None	None
8	100	LOAD_CONST          	0	None
10	83	RETURN_VALUE        	None	None
```
{: .small-code}

## A function that does nothing

Here's a function that does nothing.

>the `pass` does nothing but syntactically it is necessary to avoid an `IndentationError`


```python
def nothing():
    pass

```
...and the resulting *byte code*.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    100 LOAD_CONST           None
     2     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```


This loads `None` and returns it.
Functions always return a value and they will return `None` by default.

---

## Returning a value

Here we add a return statement.

```python
def return_something():
    return "some value"
```

...and the resulting *byte code*.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    100 LOAD_CONST           'some value'
     2     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```
Simple, the bytecode loads our value (a literal, so its constant) and returns it.

---

## Assignment

Here's something a bit more advanced (!).

```python
def assign():
    a = 1
```

...and the resulting *byte code*.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    100 LOAD_CONST           1
     2    125 STORE_FAST           a
     4    100 LOAD_CONST           None
     6     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

It loads the constant (literal), `1` and stores it in variable `a`.
It then loads `None` and returns it.

---

## Returning the value

This function does a tiny bit more, it returns the value of `a`.

```python
def assign_and_return():
    a = 1
    return a
```

...and the resulting *byte code*.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    100 LOAD_CONST           1
     2    125 STORE_FAST           a
     4    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     6     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

We can see, the code does the same but it loads from `a` rather than loading `None`.

---

## Returning an argument

This function receives a single argument and returns it.

```python
def return_argument(a):
    return a

```

...and the resulting *byte code*.


```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

The variable `a` is already available.
So it just loads it and returns it.

---

## Addition

What happens when we add numbers?


```python
def return_argument_plus_one(a):
    return a + 1

```

The *byte code* includes a new `BINARY_ADD` code.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2    100 LOAD_CONST           1
     4     23 BINARY_ADD           
     6     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

We load the value `a`, load the constant `1`, add them (presumably BINARY_ADD takes the two arguments) and return.

---

## Multiple arguments

A similar example, with two arguments.



```python
def return_argument_product_minus_one(a, b):
    return a * b - 1

```

The resultant *byte code* loads the arguments `a` and `b`, multiplies them, loads the constant `1`, subtracts it and returns the result.


```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2    124 LOAD_FAST            b
     4     20 BINARY_MULTIPLY      
     6    100 LOAD_CONST           1
     8     24 BINARY_SUBTRACT      
    10     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

---

## Conditionals


```python
def conditional_return1(a, b):
    if a:
        return a
    else:
        return b

```

The *byte code* loads `a` and then includes a `POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE` code which will *jump* to code `8` if the loaded value (i.e. `a`) is `False`.
There are two paths to a return code.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2    114 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE    to 8
     4    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     6     83 RETURN_VALUE         
     8    124 LOAD_FAST            b
    10     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

---

## More efficient?

Taking advantage of the `or` operator seems more efficient. 

```python
def conditional_return2(a, b):
    return a or b
```

The *byte code* is clearly more efficient, using `JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP`.

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2    112 JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP  to 6
     4    124 LOAD_FAST            b
     6     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```

---

## Looping

A simple while loop decrements `a` until it's less than `10`.
This leads to some moderately complex byte code.

```python
def looping1(a):
    while a > 10:
        a -= 1
    return a
```
{: .small-code}


```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     2    100 LOAD_CONST           10
     4    107 COMPARE_OP           >
     6    114 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE    to 24
     8    124 LOAD_FAST            a
    10    100 LOAD_CONST           1
    12     56 INPLACE_SUBTRACT     
    14    125 STORE_FAST           a
    16    124 LOAD_FAST            a
    18    100 LOAD_CONST           10
    20    107 COMPARE_OP           >
    22    115 POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE     to 8
    24    124 LOAD_FAST            a
    26     83 RETURN_VALUE         
```
{: .small-code}

## Alternative loop

A slightly different approach produces slightly different bytecode to achieve the same result.

```python
def looping2(a):
    while True:
        if a <= 10:
            return a
        a -= 1

```
{: .small-code}

```plaintext
       OPCODE OPERATION            ARGUMENT
     0      9 NOP                  
     2    124 LOAD_FAST            a
     4    100 LOAD_CONST           10
     6    107 COMPARE_OP           <=
     8    114 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE    to 14
    10    124 LOAD_FAST            a
    12     83 RETURN_VALUE         
    14    124 LOAD_FAST            a
    16    100 LOAD_CONST           1
    18     56 INPLACE_SUBTRACT     
    20    125 STORE_FAST           a
    22    113 JUMP_ABSOLUTE        to 2
```
{: .small-code}
