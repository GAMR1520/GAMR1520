## Object-oriented python

In python we can use the `class` keyword to create a type of our own.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

my_instance_1 = MyClass()
my_instance_2 = MyClass()
```

We know that all values in python are objects.
The values `1` and `'hello'` are instances of `int` and `str`.
Our instances are of type `MyClass` in exactly the same way.

<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart TD;
        subgraph types ["Types"]
            MyClass
            str
            int
        end
        subgraph instances [Instances]
            hello["'hello'"]
            world["'world'"]
            my_instance_1
            my_instance_2
            1
            2
        end
        1 --> int
        2 --> int
        hello --> str
        world --> str
        my_instance_1 --> MyClass
        my_instance_2 --> MyClass
    </div>
</figure>

## A class

We can refer directly to the `MyClass` class, for example, we can print it.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

print(MyClass)
print(MyClass())
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
<class '__main__.MyClass'>
<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7f656f5d15d0>
```
{: .small-margin}

Classes are *callable* and when we call them, they return an *instance*.

> In python *the file you execute* is known as the `__main__` module.
> Double underscores indicate that `__main__` is part of the python infrastructure.

---

## Attributes

In python classes create a *namespace* which can be accessed using *dot notation*.
The below code is setting the `apples` and `data` *attributes* on the `MyClass` class.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

MyClass.apples = 'hello'
print(MyClass.apples)

MyClass.data = [1, 2, 3]
print(MyClass.data)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
hello
[1, 2, 3]
```
{: .small-margin}


> This is very similar to creating variables, though the attributes are only available within the class *namespace* as `MyClass.apples` and `MyClass.data`.

---

## AttributeError

Attempting to access an attribute that has not been defined will raise an `AttributeError`.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

my_instance = MyClass()
print(my_instance.data)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/my_class.py", line 5, in <module>
    print(my_instance.data)
AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'data'
```
{: .small-margin}

> This can be circumvented by defining a `__getattr__` method.

---

## Instance attributes

Instances are also *namespaces*.
If an attribute is not found on an instance, it will be looked up on the class.
In this way, classes provide attributes that are shared across all instances.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

my_instance = MyClass()
another_instance = MyClass()

MyClass.apples = 'hello'
my_instance.apples = 'different value'

print(my_instance.apples)
print(another_instance.apples)
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
different value
hello
```
{: .small-margin}
---

## Default attributes

Classes can have attributes included in their definition. 
Anything we put inside the code block will be part of the class definition and will be available to all instances of the class.

```python
class Coordinate:
    x = 0
    y = 0

c1 = Coordinate()
c2 = Coordinate()

c1.x = 2
c2.y = -3

print(f"{c1.x=}, {c1.y=}")
print(f"{c2.x=}, {c2.y=}")
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
c1.x=2, c1.y=0
c2.x=0, c2.y=-3
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## Methods

A function defined within a class is known as a method.
What happens when we try to call `Coordinate.my_method()` from an instance?

```python
class Coordinate:
    def my_method():
        pass

c1 = Coordinate()
c1.my_method()
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
TypeError: Coordinate.my_method() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```
{: .small-margin}

Apparently our method was passed one argument, even though we passed nothing when we called it.

> This is a copy of the *instance* and it is always automatically passed into methods.

---

## What is this argument?

Let's update our code to have a look at the argument.
We'll make two instances to see the impact.

> Notice the `my_method()` function now takes one argument (`arg`) and prints it. 

```python
class Coordinate:
    def my_method(arg):
        print(arg)

c1 = Coordinate()
c2 = Coordinate()

c1.my_method()
c2.my_method()
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fc3e3cd0310>
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fc3e3cd02e0>
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## Always use `self` for this

By convention, python programmers *always* name this argument `self` to avoid confusion.
*Every* method defined on a class should add `self` as the first argument.
All subsequent arguments are treated as with normal functions.

```python
class Coordinate:
    x = 10
    y = 5

    def invert(self):
        self.x, self.y = self.y, self.x

c1 = Coordinate()

print(c1.x, c1.y)   # default class attributes
c1.invert()
print(c1.x, c1.y)   # instance attributes
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
10 5
5 10
```
{: .small-margin}
---

## The constructor method `__init__`

This is awkward.

```python
c1 = Coordinate()
c1.x = 10
c1.y = 5
```

We can define a custom *constructor* method `Coordinate.__init__()` to allow this, more convenient syntax.

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

origin = Coordinate(0, 0)
c1 = Coordinate(3, 8)
c2 = Coordinate(-4, 2)
```

Again, we take an implicit `self` argument plus whatever else we need.

---

## Printing instances

When we call `print()` on `Coordinate` instances, we get output like this. 

```python
print(Coordinate(0, 0))
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fec1d6d4280>
```
{: .small-margin}

The `print()` function calls `str()` which calls the `__str__` *method* of any object which is passed to it.
The object's `__str__` method must return a string representation of the object.

> Remember, everything is an object.

```python
print([i.__str__() for i in (1.1, True, Coordinate(0, 0))])
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
['1.1', 'True', '<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fabd3cafc10>']
```
{: .small-margin}

> Note this is `i.__str__()`, not `str(i)`.
But they are equivalent because `str(i)` calls `i.__str__()`.

---

## The default `__str__` method

Our objects are responsible for telling the `str()` constructor what a string representation should be.
So, we can define how our classes are converted into strings.

The default `__str__` implementation is something like this:

```python
def __str__(self):
    md = self.__class__.__module__
    cls = self.__class__.__name__
    return f"<{md}.{cls} object at {id(self):#x}>"
```
It provides enough information to work out what something is and where it is defined, but its not very convenient if we want to see the instance attributes of our `Coordinate`.

> All instances have a `__class__` attribute.
All classes have a `__module__` and a `__name__`. 

---

## A custom `__str__` method

We can give our class a customised `__str__` method to return a customised string.

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return f'({self.x}, {self.y})'

for x in range(2):
    for y in range(2):
        print(Coordinate(x, y))
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## The `__repr__` method

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return f'({self.x}, {self.y})'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Coordinate(x={self.x}, y={self.y})"

for x in range(2):
    for y in range(2):
        print(repr(Coordinate(x, y)))
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
Coordinate(x=0, y=0)
Coordinate(x=0, y=1)
Coordinate(x=1, y=0)
Coordinate(x=1, y=1)
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## Operators

The exact same idea is used to implement operators.
The following expressions are exactly equivalent.

```python
a - b
a.__sub__(b)
```


Obviously, the first one is a neater way of doing it and is always preferred when we want to do subtraction.
The key point here is that our `Coordinate` object can define how it interacts with operators.
Currently, it cannot be part of a subtraction operation.

```python
a = Coordinate(1, 2)
b = Coordinate(2, 1)

a - b
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "path/to/coordinate.py", line 15, in <module>
    a - b
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'Coordinate' and 'Coordinate'
```
{: .small-margin}


---

## Implementing a `__sub__` method

```python
class Coordinate:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return Coordinate(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'Coordinate({self.x}, {self.y})'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Coordinate(x={self.x}, y={self.y})"

c1 = Coordinate(1, 2)
c2 = Coordinate(3, 4)
c3 = c1 - c2
print(f"{c1} - {c2} = {c3}")
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
(1, 2) - (3, 4) = (-2, -2)
```
{: .small-margin}
