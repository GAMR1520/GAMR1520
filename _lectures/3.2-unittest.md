title: Unit testing in python
description: Writing tests for our code can help us to be braver about making changes. When we change our tested code, if the tests still pass then we can be confident we haven't broken anything important. If we find a bug, we can write a test to make sure the bug doesn't happen again. More than this, writing tests is a way to think about the design we want before we write any code.

## AssertionError

We can add assertions into our code, though it is not something usually needed in simple code.

```python
def something_complex(arg):
    result = str(arg)
    # lots of complex processing here

    # Now we can actively confirm it's a string
    # This is a message to the reader to clarify what just happened
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Woah! This should be a string here."

    # And we continue processing.
    result = "-".join(arg.split())

```

An `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` if the condition fails.
But we should never rely on these assertion errors, if they are raised, it indicates a bug.

These are ignored by the compiler in optimised mode (`python -o`).

---

## Unit testing in python

The `unittest` module allows us to write *test code* that makes *assertions* about our *application code*.
Create a `tests.py` module with classes that inherit from the `unittest.TestCase` class.

```python
import unittest

class PlayerTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

class EnemyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

```

End your module with a call to `unittest.main()`.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

---

## An abstract example

Tests are methods with names that must begin with the word `'test'`.
When the `unittest.main()` function is called, all these methods will be executed.

```python
import unittest
import the_thing_to_test

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_one_specific_scenario(self):
        self.assertTrue(the_thing_to_test.is_valid)

    def test_a_different_scenario(self):
        self.assertEqual(the_thing_to_test.times_two(3), 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

Within the methods we can call various kinds of *assertions*.

---

## Assertions

Some common assertions.

```python
self.assertEqual(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertNotEqual(first, second, msg=None)

self.assertTrue(expr, msg=None)
self.assertFalse(expr, msg=None)

self.assertListEqual(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertTupleEqual(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertSetEqual(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertDictEqual(first, second, msg=None)

self.assertAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)
self.assertNotAlmostEqual(first, second, places=7, msg=None, delta=None)
```

---

## More assertions

Some less common assertions.

```python
self.assertGreater(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertGreaterEqual(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertLess(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertLessEqual(first, second, msg=None)

self.assertIs(first, second, msg=None)
self.assertIsNot(first, second, msg=None)

self.assertIsNone(expr, msg=None)
self.assertIsNotNone(expr, msg=None)

self.assertIsInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)
self.assertIsNotInstance(obj, cls, msg=None)

self.fail(msg=None)
```

---

## The `unittest` module

```python
import unittest
from my_module import my_function

class TestMyFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(my_function(0), 0)

    def test_with_two(self):
        self.assertEqual(my_function(2), 6)

    def test_with_a_billion(self):
        self.assertEqual(my_function(1000000000), 3000000000)

    def test_with_string(self):
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            my_function('should fail with TypeError')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Look for what is being tested

It will probably be imported at the top of the page and then referenced within each test.
For example, this code is testing a module called `core` (i.e. code in **core.py**).

This `TestStackLeft` class is specifically looking at the `core.stack_left()` function.

```python
"Tests for the core 2048 functions"
import unittest
import core

class TestStackLeft(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_empty(self):
        "An empty row is unaffected by a move"
        result = core.stack_left([None, None, None, None])
        self.assertEqual(result, [None, None, None, None])
```

The `TestStackLeft.test_empty()` function is testing the case where an empty row is passed into the `core.stack_left` function. In this case, the function should have no effect.

---

## Possible `core.stack_left` implementation

We need to create a `core` module, that's just a *core.py* file.

Inside the file, we need to implement a `stack_left()` function.

```python
def stack_left(data):
    """Move the non-None items in one row to the left"""
    return [None, None, None, None]
```

This function passes our test.

Since our tests are incomplete, we can get away with a stupid function that ignores the input and returns the same list every time. 

---

Testing the `core.stack_left` function under different circumstances.

```python
    def test_one_value(self):
        "A single non-None tile should be moved to the left"
        result = core.stack_left([None, None, 2, None])
        self.assertEqual(result, [2, None,  None, None])

    def test_two_values(self):
        "Two non-None tiles should be moved to the left and retain their order"
        result = core.stack_left([None, 2, None, 4])
        self.assertEqual(result, [2, 4,  None, None])

    def test_three_values(self):
        "Three non-None tiles should be moved to the left and retain their order"
        result = core.stack_left([None, 2, 4, 2])
        self.assertEqual(result, [2, 4, 2, None])

    def test_four_values(self):
        "All non-None tiles should not move"
        result = core.stack_left([4, 2, 4, 2])
        self.assertEqual(result, [4, 2, 4, 2])
```

---

## Possible `core.stack_left` implementations

Pass all the tests.

```python
def stack_left(row):
    """Move the non-None items in one row to the left"""
    result = [None, None, None, None]
    stack_index = 0
    for tile in row:
        if tile:
            result[stack_index] = tile
            stack_index += 1
    return result
```

A more *pythonic* version which uses the `sorted` builtin function with a custom *key*.

```python
def stack_left(row):
    """move the non-None items in one row to the left"""
    return sorted(row, key=lambda tile: tile is None)
```

## The working final game

Download the <a href="{{ "assets/solutions/week 3/code/core.py" | relative_url }}" download>core.py</a> library of helper functions. 
It includes stuff like this.

```python
def stack_left(row):
    """move the non-None items in one row to the left"""
    return sorted(row, key=lambda tile: tile is None)

def merge_left(stacked_row):
    """Merge similar non-None items to the left"""
    for i in range(3):
        if stacked_row[i] and stacked_row[i] == stacked_row[i+1]:
            stacked_row[i] *= 2
            stacked_row[i + 1] = None
    return stacked_row

def row_left(row):
    """A full move involves stacking, merging and then stacking again"""
    stacked = stack_left(row)
    merged = merge_left(stacked)
    return stack_left(merged)
```

## Coming Soon 

Next year we have some important things to do.

- A `unittest.TestCase` lab exercise
- A python assignment (a series of `unittest.TestCase` classes) *worth 40%*
- Lab time allocated to completing the python assignment
- An introduction to javascript and the HTML canvas
- A *game-like* javascript animation exercise
- A javascript assignment
- Lab time allocated to completing the javascript assignment

> **Take a break**.
>
If you enjoyed tkinter, then try to build the 2048 game.
The instructions should be clear enough.
If you jump ahead to future materials, I'd focus on unit testing for the assignment.
