## A python coding assignment

This assignment will test your ability to understand, modify and write python code.

- The assignment is worth **40%** of the total module mark.
- The deadline is the end of next week (**Friday January 17th at 13:00**)
{:.spaced}

We have only one exercise this week, *"An introduction to unit testing in python"*.
Following on from [the last lecture]({{"lectures/3.2-unittest" | relative_url }}), this will be crucial to understanding the assignment.

You will be expected to work on the assignment in your own time but there will be at least five hours of timetabled lab sessions allocated to working on this assignment.

> Bring your questions to the lab sessions.

---

## What do I need to do?

The assignment is presented as 40 python unit tests in three parts.

```
GAMR1520 python assignment
  ├── module1.py
  ├── module2.py
  ├── module3.py
  ├── test_all.py
  ├── test_module1.py
  ├── test_module2.py
  └── test_module3.py
```

The files *test_module1.py*, *test_module2.py* and *test_module3.py* contain the tests.
**You must not modify the test code**, an exact copy will be used to mark your work.

> The file *test_all.py* can be used to run *all the tests*, to see your total score.

The files *module1.py*, *module2.py* and *module3.py* contain broken/incomplete implementations that you must fix and/or complete to pass the tests.

---

## Marking scheme

**80%** of the assignment mark will be awarded for passing tests.
Since there are 40 tests, this equates to **2%** per test.

- *module1.py* is worth **10%** (*test_module1.py* contains *five* tests) 
- *module2.py* is worth **50%** (*test_module2.py* contains *twenty-five* tests) 
- *module3.py* is worth **20%** (*test_module3.py* contains *ten* tests)
{:.spaced}

The remaining **20%** of the mark will be awarded for good code style ([PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) compliance), readability and efficiency in each of the three modules.
> We are expecting well-structured python code.
> It doesn't need to be perfect but please take care to tidy it up before submission.

You should aim to have completed a good portion of the assignment (*e.g. 20 passing tests*) by the end of tomorrow.
The first 20 tests are *much easier* than the second half.

> REMEMBER: The test code should not be modified, you only need to modify the modules under test (*module1.py*, *module2.py* and *module3.py*)

---

## *module1.py*

This first set of problems is a very basic introduction to the process.
**module1.py** contains a few simple variables, two functions and a class definition.

```python
this = 'hard'

comfortable = 'wait'
it = 'different'

def my_function():
    return 'nothing'

def my_function_with_an_argument(arg):
    print(arg)

class MyPython:
    level = 'not sure'
```

We will see that **test_module1.py** contains five simple tests, all of which fail.

You need to update *module1.py* to pass all the tests.
This should take no more than about 15 minutes.

---

## `TestModule1.test1_this_should_be_easy`

This is the first test.

```python
import unittest
import module1

class TestModule1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test1_this_should_be_easy(self):
        self.assertEqual(module1.this, 'easy')
```

This is the relevant code and the output from running the test.

```python
this = 'hard'
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
AssertionError: 'hard' != 'easy'
- hard
+ easy
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## `TestModule1.test2_it_should_be_comfortable`

The second test asserts that two variables should be equal.

```python
import unittest
import module1

class TestModule1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test2_it_should_be_comfortable(self):
        self.assertEqual(module1.it, module1.comfortable)
```

This is the relevant code and the output from the failing test.

```python
comfortable = 'wait'
it = 'different'
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
AssertionError: 'different' != 'wait'
- different
+ wait
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## `TestModule1.test3_my_function_returns_hello_world`

The third test is looking at the return value of `my_function()`.

```python
import unittest
import module1

class TestModule1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test3_my_function_returns_hello_world(self):
        result = module1.my_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, 'hello world')
```

Here's the function and the output from the failing test.

```python
def my_function():
    return 'nothing'
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
AssertionError: 'nothing' != 'hello world'
- nothing
+ hello world
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## `test4_my_function_with_an_argument_returns_the_argument`

The next test includes two assertions testing the function with two different inputs.

```python
import unittest
import module1

class TestModule1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test4_my_function_with_an_argument_returns_the_argument(self):
        result_with_test = module1.my_function_with_an_argument('test')
        self.assertEqual(result_with_test, 'test')
        result_with_five = module1.my_function_with_an_argument(5)
        self.assertEqual(result_with_five, 5)
```

Here's the existing function.
It fails the test with this output.

```python
def my_function_with_an_argument(arg):
    print(arg)
```
{: .small-margin}

```plaintext
AssertionError: None != 'test'
```
{: .small-margin}

---

## `TestModule1.test5_MyPython_level_is_good_enough`

The final test in the first set is looking at an attribute of a class.

```python
import unittest
import module1

class TestModule1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test5_MyPython_level_is_good_enough(self):
        self.assertEqual(module1.MyPython.level, 'good enough')
```

The code looks like this.

```python
class MyPython:
    level = 'not sure'
```
{: .small-margin}
```plaintext
AssertionError: 'not sure' != 'good enough'
- not sure
+ good enough
```
{: .small-margin}

The test fails with a familiar error.

---

## module2.py

The second module contains stub implementations for five functions.

The functions have no arguments defined and no return values.
Each has just an empty code block. 

```python
def function1():
    pass

def function2():
    pass

def function3():
    pass

def function4():
    pass

def function5():
    pass
```

Completing these functions with the correct arguments, logic and return values is worth up to **50%** of the assignment (20% of the entire module mark).

---

## The `TestFunction1` class

Here's a couple of example tests for `function1()` from the `TestFunction1` class.
They assert that the function should convert `"hello"` into `"hellohellohello"` and it should also convert `1` into `"111"`.

```python
import unittest
import module2

class TestFunction1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_string(self):
        result = module2.function1('hello')
        self.assertEqual(result, 'hellohellohello')

    def test_with_integer(self):
        result = module2.function1(1)
        self.assertEqual(result, '111')
```

Both tests fail with the same error.

```plaintext
TypeError: function1() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```

---

## The `TestFunction2` class

Here's a couple of example tests for `function2()` from the `TestFunction2` class.
They assert that the function should convert the arguments `3`, `2` and `1` into `5` and it should also convert the arguments `1`, `2` and `3` into `-1`.

```python
import unittest
import module2

class TestFunction2(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_321(self):
        result = module2.function2(3, 2, 1)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_with_123(self):
        result = module2.function2(1, 2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, -1)
```

Both tests fail with the same error.

```plaintext
TypeError: function2() takes 0 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

---

## The `TestFunction3` class

Here's a couple of example tests for `function3()` from the `TestFunction3` class.
They assert that the function should convert the arguments `"hello world"` and `10` into `"hello w..."` and it should also convert the arguments `"hello world"` and `5` into `"he..."`.

```python
import unittest
import module2

class TestFunction3(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hello_world_10(self):
        result = module2.function3('hello world', 10)
        self.assertEqual(result, 'hello w...')

    def test_hello_world_5(self):
        result = module2.function3('hello world', 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, 'he...')
```

Both tests fail with the same error.

```plaintext
TypeError: function3() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given
```

---


## The `TestFunction4` class

The `TestFunction4` class provides tests for `function4()`.
Here's a couple of tests.

```python
class TestFunction4(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hello_world(self):
        """Using the default tag type produces a <div>"""
        result = module2.function4('hello world')
        self.assertEqual(result, '<div>hello world</div>')
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
TypeError: function4() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```
{:.small-margin}

Notice they show different errors this time.

```python
class TestFunction4(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hello_world_p(self):
        """Specifying the tag type works"""
        result = module2.function4('hello world', 'p')
        self.assertEqual(result, '<p>hello world</p>')```
```
{:.small-margin}
```plaintext
TypeError: function4() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given
```
{:.small-margin}

---

## The `TestFunction5` class

The `TestFunction5` class provides tests for `function5()`.
Here's a couple of tests.

```python
class TestFunction5(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_5_2(self):
        result = module2.function5(5, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, "*****\n*****")

    def test_2_5(self):
        result = module2.function5(2, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, "**\n**\n**\n**\n**")
```

Hopefully you get the idea.
The code in `function5()` needs to produce a formatted string.
In this case, the first argument is the number of columns and the second argument is the number of rows.
It seems that there should be an asterisk in each cell.


```plaintext
function5(5, 2)    =    *****                   function5(2, 5)    =    **
                        *****                                           **
                                                                        **
                                                                        **
                                                                        **
```
{: .tight}

## module3.py - `Grid`

The final set of tests in *test_module3.py* define two classes `Grid` and `Game`.

```python
class TestGrid(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_grid(self):
        empty_grid = "\n".join([
            "   |   |   ",
            "---+---+---",
            "   |   |   ",
            "---+---+---",
            "   |   |   "
        ])
        my_grid = Grid()
        self.assertEqual(str(my_grid), empty_grid)
```

For example, the provided `Grid` class lacks a `__str__` method.

```python
class Grid:
    pass
```

---

## module3.py - `Game`

The tests indicate that the `Game` class should have a `Grid` instance as an attribute.

```python
class TestGame(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_properties(self):
        game = Game()
        self.assertIsInstance(game.grid, Grid)
        self.assertEqual(game.turn, 'X')
        self.assertEqual(game.status, "X's turn")
        self.assertFalse(game.game_over)
```

The provided `Game` class also lacks the attributes `turn`, `status` and `game_over`.

```python
class Grid:
    pass
```

These are just two of the tests defined in *test_module3.py*.
If you manage to build a working game that passes all ten tests then well done, you deserve to achieve a high mark.

## PEP8 - Basic code layout

**20%** of your mark will be awarded for good code style ([PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) compliance).

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Indent with four spaces (not tabs!)
- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.
- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

```python
class MyThing:

    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.something = [a, b]

    def a_method(self):
        return self.something[0] - self.something[-1] * 10

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.something[0]}: {self.something[-1]}"
```

> *code is read much more often than it is written* - **PEP8**

---


## PEP8 - imports

> Imports go at the top of the file, 
after any module comments or docstrings, before constants.

```python
"""
This is a module...                                           
"""                                                           # docstring

import os                                                     # Standard library
import sys
from random import random, randint

from external_library import some_class, something_else       # Third party

from mypkg import my_function                                 # Local

MY_CONSTANT = 1                                               # constants
```

> Wildcard imports (```from <module> import *```) should be avoided

---

## PEP8 - Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces:
```python
spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})                     # Correct
spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )               # Wrong
```

Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis:
```python
foo = (0,)                                  # Correct
bar = (0, )                                 # Wrong
```

Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:
```python
if x == 4: print(x, y)                      # Correct
if x == 4 : print(x , y)                    # Wrong
```

> These examples are taken directly from PEP8

---

## PEP8 - Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call:
```python
spam(1)                                     # Correct
spam (1)                                    # Wrong
```

Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing:
```python
dct['key'] = lst[index]                     # Correct
dct ['key'] = lst [index]                   # Wrong
```

More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with another:
```python
x = 1                                       # Correct
y = 2                                       # Correct
long_variable = 3                           # Correct
x             = 1                           # Wrong
y             = 2                           # Wrong
```
---

## PEP8 - Operators vs keyword arguments

Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (`=`), augmented assignment (`+=`, `-=` etc.), comparisons (`==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, `<>`, `<=`, `>=`, `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`), Booleans (`and`, `or`, `not`).

```python
a = 1                                       # Correct
a=1                                         # Wrong
```

But...

Don’t use spaces around the `=` sign when used to indicate a keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an unannotated function parameter:
```python
# Correct:
def complex(real, imag=0.0):
    return magic(r=real, i=imag)

# Wrong:
def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
    return magic(r = real, i = imag)
```

---


## PEP8 - naming

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary.
Sometimes called *snake_case*.

```python
def a_long_function_name():
    do_something()
```

Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

```python
a_long_variable_name = "try to make sure the name makes sense when used in your code"
speed = distance / time
```

Class names should normally use the *CamelCase* convention.

```python
class MyClass:
    a_method(self):
        do_something()
```

---

## Conclusion

Hopefully you get the idea.

You are provided with the bare minimum code.

There are many tests and they all fail.

**You should get familiar with running tests and interpreting the output.**
{:.large}

You need to *edit the code being tested* to make it pass the tests.

You must **not** edit the test code, only the modules under test.

**You should work on it one step (one test, one function, one class) at a time.**
{:.large}

The first ones should be easy, the later ones are harder.

Tidy up your code before you submit.
