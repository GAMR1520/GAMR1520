This week we will be looking at two very useful python libraries.
We will continue our data processing experiments by grabbing some *JSON* data from the web using `urllib.request` to make HTTP requests.
We will also spend some time looking at the user interface toolkit `tkinter` and built a simple object-oriented GUI application.
