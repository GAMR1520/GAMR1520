title: Object-oriented python and some useful libraries
lang: python
---

This week we will be looking at object-oriented python as well as two very useful python libraries as we continue to practice writing well-structured python programmes.

First we will introduce the `class` keyword and python's object-oriented model in some detail.
We will then continue our data processing experiments by grabbing some *JSON* data from the web using `urllib.request` to make HTTP requests.
Finally, we will spend some time looking at the user interface toolkit `tkinter` and built a simple object-oriented GUI application.
