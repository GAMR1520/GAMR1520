week: 4
title: Unit testing
lang: python
---

This week is the final week of python.
The focus is on unit testing in preparation for the python assignment.
Unit tests allow us to write code that acts as a specification for how other code should behave.
With unit tests, we can automatically test whether our code produces given outputs when given certain inputs.
This not only allows us to know whether code is working, it also highlights places where we introduce bugs.
