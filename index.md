### Markup languages and scripting

In this module we will be focusing on the power and flexibility of dynamically typed languages.
Essentially a programming module, we will be working with two (two!) extremely popular and powerful programming languages: 

- <img src="assets/img/python-logo-only.svg" class="inline" alt="python logo"> *Python* 
- <img src="assets/img/js-logo.svg" class="inline" alt="js logo"> *JavaScript*.

Both languages are interpreted and have dynamically typed variables.
This makes them very fast to learn and extremely powerful.

>The intent of this module is to provide a launchpad for your own research and development.
After six weeks you will not be experts, but will have developed a solid foundation in programming with both Python and Javascript.

## Timetabled classes

The module runs over six timetabled weeks with two one-hour lectures and eight hours of practical labs per week.
The lab materials can be followed during sessions but you should also review the materials in your own time.

The [lectures](lectures) will help you to develop an understanding of the context for the module as well as introduce theoretical material and details of the syntax and functionality of the core technologies.
The [lab exercises](labs) will help to develop the procedural knowledge you will need to write your own code.

> Perhaps more importantly, the lab exercises will also help you to develop the perspective of a programmer and allow you to participate in the process of coding with your colleagues in the laboratory setting.

Every Tuesday we will begin with a [lecture](lectures) covering the key material and linking out to further information.
This will be followed by five hours of practical sessions in which you will work through the [prepared lab exercises](labs). 
On Thursday we have another lecture consolidating and expanding on the material and a final three-hour lab in which we will set coding challenges to test your developing skills.
