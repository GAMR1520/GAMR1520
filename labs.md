title: Lab materials
---

The lab materials are organised as a series of interlinked web pages containing introductory materials, example code and exercises which you should attempt.
You will find the same pages are linked multiple times, often as reminders of the basic concepts.
Please read each page at least once and use your judgement as to whether you need to review concepts or can skip over them when they are linked again.


## Python

<!-- {% include python_header.md %} -->

We will begin with Python, providing a general introduction to dynamically typed languages and as a tool for manipulating data.
Python is an extremely popular language due to its supportive community and very simple syntax.
We will cover procedural, functional and object-oriented programming styles in python.



### Week 1: Introducing python

In the first week we will be looking at the fundamentals of programming in python. 
Beginning with the very basics and moving towards writing basic scripts.

[The first lab exercise](lab-1.1) introduces the IDLE environment and covers the very basic concepts such as literals, operators, variables and assignment.
We will mostly be dealing with simple, one-line expressions in the python interpreter.

 and to more complex python programmes in our own modules.

This is followed up with [a second set of exercises](lab-1.2) looking at the more complex data types and the difference between mutable and immutable types.

- [Lab 1.1: Introduction to python](lab-1.1) 
- [Lab 1.2: Compound data types and looping](lab-1.2)


### Week 2: Working with data

- Lab 2.1: Files and folders
- Lab 2.2: JSON
- Lab 2.3: CSV

### Week 3: Structuring python code

- Lab 3.1: ?
- Lab 3.2: ?
- Lab 3.3: ?

## Javascript

<!-- {% include js_header.md %} -->

We will then move on to using Javascript to build a simple game-like system in the web browser.
Javascript is *the* language of the web.
Writing code that executes within the web browser gives us access to a powerful platform for developing user interfaces.


> **Be scientific**
>
> As you work through these exercises, make sure you experiment.
> *Write your own code and predict what will happen*. 
> Be inquisitive, and see if your instincts are correct.
> If something unexpected happens, this is good.
> It's time to stop and think.

> **Don't let it go**
>
> The material is just a guide, your task is to become a good python programmer.
> If you're not sure, *ask the obvious questions*.
> Ask your colleagues or tutor as necessary.
>
> If you understand the material, try to come up with really hard questions.
> *We don't know everything*, if we don't know the answer, we can learn together.
