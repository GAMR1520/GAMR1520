### Markup languages and scripting

In this module we will be focusing on the power and flexibility of dynamically typed languages.
Essentially a programming module, we will be working with two (two!) extremely popular and powerful programming languages: 

- <img src="assets/img/python-logo-only.svg" class="inline" alt="python logo"> *Python* 
- <img src="assets/img/js-logo.svg" class="inline" alt="js logo"> *JavaScript*.

Both languages are interpreted and have dynamically typed variables.
This makes them very fast to learn and extremely powerful.

>The intent of this module is to provide a launchpad for your own research and development.
After six weeks you will not be experts, but will have developed a solid foundation in programming with both Python and Javascript.

## Timetabled classes

The module runs over six timetabled weeks with two one-hour lectures and eight hours of practical labs per week.
The lab materials can be followed during sessions but you should also review the materials in your own time.

The lectures will help you to develop an understanding of the context for the module as well as introduce theoretical material and details of the syntax and functionality of the core technologies.
The lab exercises will help to develop the procedural knowledge you will need to write your own code.

> Perhaps more importantly, the lab exercises will also help you to develop the perspective of a programmer and allow you to participate in the process of coding with your colleagues in the laboratory setting.

Every Tuesday we will begin with a lecture covering the key material and linking out to further information.
This will be followed by five hours of practical sessions in which you will work through the prepared lab exercises. 
On Thursday we have another lecture consolidating and expanding on the material and a final three-hour lab in which we will set coding challenges to test your developing skills.

## Staff

**Module leader**: Graeme Stuart (gstuart@dmu.ac.uk)

There will be a variety of other lab tutors, who you may contact outside of your timetabled classes. Please view the Staff Contacts page in the virtual learning environment for the latest information on the full list of lab tutors that support this module.

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module,  the student will be able to:

1. Demonstrate knowledge of how information is stored and structured within markup files.
2. Implement and describe simple programs which demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts of programming a scripted language. 
3. Describe the context in which it is appropriate to use dynamically typed programming languages. 
4. Use a suitable API to parse and manipulate data.
5. Construct and manipulate 2D graphics in a web browser.

## Main topic areas

The core topic areas covered in the module include:

- Basics of programming (types, variables, operators, control flow)
- Fundamentals of python/JavaScript
- Procedural/functional/object-oriented programming
- I/O and storing data using markup languages
- The HTML canvas and Scalar Vector Graphics
